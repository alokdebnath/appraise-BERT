0,Despair. I wish I had nobody in my life so I feel no remorse for the last stage of my life,"I know what you mean. When I was suicidal the pain I would cause my family was sometimes the only thing that held me back. I tried to think of them as living proof that Depression (personified for metaphor) was wrong about me. It told me nobody cares, nothing matters, if you died nothing would change. I showed it my mother and sister, and told it even if you see no value in me, others do. Basically, in my mind, I used my family as a logical check against the lies. Depression knows it is irrational; like a con man, it relies on persuasion rather than facts. But even when it takes over all of your other emotions, it can't take control of the emotions of others.",0,0,2,1,0.5879534482955933,0.29843732714653015,0.5508410930633545,0.2655324339866638,0.5228604674339294,0.44458529353141785,0.5918139815330505,0.48874038457870483,0.11149793863296509,0.6449810266494751,0.5326229929924011,0.5756502151489258,0.5798335075378418,0.4044293165206909,0.4858464300632477,0.3101481795310974,0.5181970000267029,0.5466492176055908,0.6795163154602051,0.7202796339988708,0,0.3759132921695709,0.15882016718387604,0.5875183343887329,0.4085393249988556,0.6066599488258362,0.274494469165802,0.32990598678588867,0.5654720664024353,0.14651189744472504,0.4220370948314667,0.47311681509017944,0.30569347739219666,0.6851901412010193,0.6681584715843201,0.3045390546321869,0.26042377948760986,0.5330579280853271,0.6481437683105469,0.7716273069381714,0.9752447605133057
1,"What are some things I can do to boost my confidence, motivation and happiness while in University?. Been feeling down in the gutter lately.","I did feel the same way as you, and some days I still do. Some things that I've done that seemed to work: Exercise, if Im exercising and going to the gym the consistency seems to flow to other parts of my life. Joining a club at uni, having friends keep me motivated in my studies. Also sort of having something to do outside of classes (I don't have a job). Make friends in your course, it helps to know you're not the only one in struggle town, and if you get stuck you can ask someone. Also think hard about why you're studying what you're studying, be in it for the right reasons. Keep in mind university isn't for everyone, and it isn't the only way to lead a fulfilling life. Also career changes are very common so since you're in your final year you can just stick it out and know that the future awaits. You're not locked into doing whatever your degree says you have to do. I think a lot of students are in the same boat, and good on you for making this post and trying to work out what you can do about it.

You can build from there and go on to help more people.",1,0,0,1,0.39773955941200256,0.23246750235557556,0.6010128259658813,0.27757036685943604,0.5525139570236206,0.3675806224346161,0.6433454155921936,0.44443047046661377,0.14001981914043427,0.4264468252658844,0.4868035316467285,0.41754770278930664,0.6710203289985657,0.4162745475769043,0.4092411994934082,0.24187597632408142,0.5564423203468323,0.5430943965911865,0.6506320834159851,0.6645607352256775,0,0.5141048431396484,0.43640196323394775,0.4787824749946594,0.2464849203824997,0.23883187770843506,0.29495346546173096,0.3449716866016388,0.6855121850967407,0.7383948564529419,0.5590202212333679,0.565973162651062,0.4682844877243042,0.40072789788246155,0.807671070098877,0.39093783497810364,0.22690096497535706,0.2636245787143707,0.5239137411117554,0.6919121742248535,0.42459413409233093

49,Laziness or lack of motivation.. How have some of you battled depression related laziness?,"Hi Talk2muchaa, Lik onus111 suggested, 'feeling like doing something' just does not happen. If you're deeply unhappy with a lack of activity in your life, you just need to force yourself to do it - That's the sad reality of it. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that there aren't ways to make FORCING yourself 'easier' on your mind and less stressful. If you want to build a house consisting of a 1000 bricks, take 30 seconds a day to lay 3 bricks and in one year, you will have a house. You can't punish yourself for not building Rome in a day. You will go on Twitch and see streamers who are making millions... YouTubers who are making millions. I mean fuck, PewDiePie has 56 million subscribers. But that shit didn't happen in just one day. You need to break shit up into increments. Perhaps others don't have to do this. But it's the only way I've found to get anything done. If you want to learn a language, go on Duolingo. Set a '10 points per day' challenge. Yes, it's jack-shit in terms of work. It takes literally 2 minutes a day, BUT- it's something. Try and ignore your brain saying Increase the goal to 50 a day, we're getting fuck-all done because this will break your discipline and you'll go back to 0 a day. Consistently doing 10 a day for 11 days, is better than doing 50 a day for 2 days, burning out and stopping altogether. The key to beating depression-induced laziness is TINY, incremental steps. For example, I'm learning Calculus on Khan Academy. One. Lesson. A Day. That's right- the average Khan video is around 10 minutes. I do one video a day. I am slowly, but consistently learning. Each day I go over the notes from the previous day.

52,Anybody else trying to drink until they don't wake up tomorrow?. Shit i dont wanna experiecne another day tbh,"Currently? No. But 12 days ago I drank until I blacked out just trying to forget my feelings and forget everything until morning. My subconscious, drunk brain had other plans. I tried to hang myself from a bridge but luckily was too drunk to execute it. I ended up with broken bones in both my feet, a required 5 day stay in a hospital behavior and addiction unit, and no memory of what I had done or even ever feeling suicidal. 12 days sober and have accepted that I have a binge drinking problem.

86,Why do i have to exist. Why was i born to experience this endless suffering,I know if this is comforting but there is no reason why. You just were born. I get the same thought as you often. I think of how there is much more net suffering than net joy in life.

87,Does anyone have a chronic physical condition and suffers from depression?. I do and I'm just morbidly curious as to know if there is anyone that feels their overarching condition physiologically or psychologically affects them.,I'm locked in a viscous cycle between my physical and mental illnesses. Been diagnosed with major depressive disorder for close to 5 years now. About 2 years ago I developed a movement disorder. It has been documented but not yet diagnosed as doctors haven't figured out anything about it. The depression triggers the non epileptic seizures which cause major disturbances in my life. Crippling my quality of life and reducing what I can do. This feeds into my depression. More negative mental health the worse and more frequent the seizure like symptoms happen. Also have bad tremors and ticks in relation to the non epileptic seizures. I often fall down and have issues walking and standing. Can barely leave my home. Am reduces to limit movement inside my home which has caused weight gain from decrease movements which also stregnthens my depression which in return causes more seizure like episodes. No medication helps my mental or physical health. It actually worsens both. I am going without treatment because doctors refuse to take it seriously or are completely dumbfounded. It has been over a year since anything was prescribed to attempt to help me. Seen several specialist. This terrible cycle has lead me to multiple suicide attempts in the last few months.,0,0,2,1,0.5131818056106567,0.16070334613323212,0.5252909660339355,0.3946056663990021,0.576264500617981,0.3328106105327606,0.24611343443393707,0.6638092994689941,0.14840348064899445,0.48390716314315796,0.4600261151790619,0.4256669580936432,0.47919905185699463,0.69125896692276,0.2615799009799957,0.24758844077587128,0.5415999293327332,0.5276790857315063,0.6385053396224976,0.7324753403663635,0,0.3526166081428528,0.17000974714756012,0.44153162837028503,0.41206350922584534,0.5207171440124512,0.3313891291618347,0.29384979605674744,0.5816667079925537,0.10080591589212418,0.328832745552063,0.535363495349884,0.2593371570110321,0.7278436422348022,0.4638671875,0.20731480419635773,0.03844008967280388,0.5233622193336487,0.6889965534210205,0.7464573979377747,0.5696378350257874

90,I am feeling very lonely.. My best friend moved to a different country this past year and I had an extreme emotional connection to him. A girl that i had a crush on also left around the same time. I am trying to make friends but I think they really don't like me. I am just feeling so tired of this constant empty feeling inside of my body. I am 16 years old and i just hate school. How should I handle this situation?,"Man I just turned 17 yesterday and I dont think ive had a real life friend since highschool started, so basically I dont think i'll be very helpful but i'd still like to respond. I also dropped out a few weeks ago which I do regret but I just couldnt keep up with the new school I transfered to. The thing that has been helping me lately, and what my pyschiatrist told me, was to get a hobby. I like to read a lot of japanese books so I picked up on the language so I could start reading them directly from Japan. It's not much of a hobby, reading books and learning a new language, but it gives me something to live for. I want to read a thousand new stories because I love many of the ones I have already read. I do however think friends are important, although I have none in real life. If anyone at all tries to be your friend, I think you should try and be more open to making friends instead of like me. The last person that tried being friends with me I pushed away a lot and faked most of our friendship, but I regret that since he was willing to put in the effort so I think he deserves to have a good friendship. Don't be fake, people will like you for who you are.",1,0,2,1,0.4462973475456238,0.2462531179189682,0.5740184783935547,0.3212222158908844,0.5294947028160095,0.21637864410877228,0.4093722403049469,0.6850655674934387,0.21775512397289276,0.5183119773864746,0.514631450176239,0.4215069115161896,0.5224155187606812,0.6691602468490601,0.3838711082935333,0.23878546059131622,0.43024417757987976,0.5855005383491516,0.7310869097709656,0.7069514393806458,0,0.4682598114013672,0.29990631341934204,0.4553588926792145,0.33455371856689453,0.5059022307395935,0.29244935512542725,0.5180051922798157,0.5868600606918335,0.2942827641963959,0.4058206379413605,0.5500109791755676,0.2905508875846863,0.625754177570343,0.4644884765148163,0.3776080310344696,0.18219412863254547,0.5042277574539185,0.6625232696533203,0.6979966163635254,0.5353409051895142

98,How do you feel. What is life with depression? Tell me your story,"To answer your question, I'm actually feeling alright today. Had an existential crisis last night and probably would have ended up killing myself or at the very least cutting myself if it wasn't for my dog licking my hand as I layed in bed crying myself to sleep (she's NEVER an affectionate dog, it took me a minute to even realise that she was actually licking my hand and I wasn't imagining shit). Thanks, Charlie. Anyways, for me depression is like absolute insanity. It's not just sadness or feeling like killing myself every other week. Just pure insanity. The best example I can give is probably two years ago, seventh grade. That was probably the lowest I had ever been. Every night when I went to sleep, I'd stay up on my phone. Not because I wanted to be, because it kept me from going to sleep and having the same nightmares I had every night. And then I'd look at the time, which by now was probably about 12 AM, realise how absolutely sad and pathetic I was and turn on some emo music, usually being something like Set it Off's I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and listen to that as I (literally) sadistically laugh and cry myself to sleep. Some nights, that kind of stuff never happened. I'd have a peaceful sleep. Some nights I'd stay up all night debating whether I should text the suicide hotline, doing so, and it being no help whatsoever. So I'd get, maybe six hours of sleep at most. Before I'm woken up and have to get ready for school. How am I woken up? By my parents during the best part of my dream or the most peaceful part of my nightmare. Which already started my day off terribly. Then for an hour I'd be in the bathroom once again listening to emo music as I let the shower water run. My favourite songs to listen to were usually just about anything by Hollywood Undead. Not something a twelve year old should be listening to, sure. But it was a way to cope with my depression. As I listen to those songs, once again sadistically laughing at my own pain and often times end up cutting myself. I never cut myself deep, I was far to afraid of doing that. But... I enjoyed seeing the blood come out. I didn't cut for any sort of high or release of pain. It was sort of hard to explain. I was never addicted to cutting, I could stop or start whenever I wanted. Sometimes stopping for months at a time, but seeing the blood, made me feel happy. If you could have seen my eyes, especially when I cut myself, you wouldn't have seen any traces of a twelve year old. You'd see an insane person desperately trying to grasp on to the last straw of sanity, but nothing else. Some days I'd debate whether I should do a sort of murder-suicide thing. Or at the very least murder those who have caused me pain and suffering. Sometimes I'd have very and scarily elaborate plans on how I'd trick, kidnap, or kill my family. Things that you'd never expect from a twelve year old. But quite frankly, I might have physically been twelve, but my depression had probably aged and matured me way faster. The ride to school was probably the most traumatic for me. The ride was only about ten minutes (five minutes to school, five minutes in the carpool line). But those ten minutes were full of tests streaming down my face, me punching myself or ripping my hair out, or destroying my notebooks or pencils. Sometimes because I just really didn't want to go to school. Sometimes because my social anxiety got the best of me. Sometimes for reasons I don't even know. Me and my grandma would usually sit at the front of the school for about an hour or two, I'm sitting there trying to find a way to hurt myself because I'm angry, but don't want to let my anger out on her, and she's crying because she's absolutely lost on how to help me. I'd usually end up getting to school about a good three hours late. In school, I don't remember anything. Maybe it's because I was just walking around the school like a robot. Class for an hour, find your next class, repeat. In class, I'd have my head down in a book (not paying attention to the teacher whatsoever), I'd be mindlessly reciting the emo songs I listen to in my head, or I'd be talking to my friend AIDEN. (Yes, his name is in all caps). What I do definitely remember is hating all of my peers. Hell, I still hate them. It's not my hatred for them itself. It's just I can't stand how immature, idiotic, and stupid they were. Like who the hell goes around sticking Tide pods in their mouths for views on social media? Or who thinks it's funny to go around telling people to kill themselves because you heard your favourite edgy YouTuber say it and now you think it's hilarious to do so. Or why do you think it's cool and okay to curse every five seconds and use the N-word? Or why do you think that because you saw Kim Kardashian half naked in some photo shoot that you can show up to school with hardly any clothes on or sag and talk about fucking whores because your favourite rapper said it in their newest song? Act your own god damn age, quit trying to act like someone three times your age while being as immature as a kindergartener. More on AIDEN: AIDEN sort of just appeared out of nowhere. I don't know when or why I came up with him, I just sort of did. I'm not schizophrenic, he was 100% my own voice talking back to me in my head, but I enjoyed pretending to have someone to talk to. Someone who walked around with me everyday, knew exactly what I was thinking, and could relate to me all the time. Someone who (though was just my own voice), talked me out of suicide many times back in 7th grade. But slowly I started treating AIDEN a lot more like a real person. To the point where I could have easily been mistaken as someone with schizophrenia. At home I'd just go into my room and basically lock myself in. My door was never locked, my parents could come in and out as they pleased, but I would just hand out under the covers all day. I didn't want to see light, light didn't want to see me. I didn't bother with homework. I figured, I fail, I fail. I really had just given up with life at that point. The only reason why I hadn't killed myself was probably because I was too sad and lazy to bother trying. Occasionally I'd talk to AIDEN or watch YouTube or something, but most times I ended up listening to hypnosis. Hypnosis for me was like a way to escape real life. Like meditation, but instead of being left alone with my sad and depressing thoughts, I could listen to someone else. At first it was a nice little escape, but then it more or less because an addiction. An odd strange one that I'd never be able to explain to anyone, but an addiction none the less. I'd try to listen to hypnosis any time I could even if that meant going into my room away from family to listen to it. It kind of gave me the same high that cutting, smoking, drugs, or porn give other people. Even though it was just hypnosis, it really did become unhealthy. Before I knew it, it was time for me to go to bed. And then the whole cycle would repeat itself over and over and over and over and over again. It was the same routine, same schedule, same insanity over and over again. This sounds like more is going on than just depression, right? Like some other underlying mental illness. But this is all depression and a bit of social anxiety. No MPD, no schizophrenia, no bipolar disorder, I'm not a psychopath or sociopath. This was all thanks to my depression. No one actually knew how bad my mental state was. I never told anyone. I was diagnosed with depression and put on meds, but if anyone really knew how bad it was, I likely truly would have been put in a mental health hospital. This is where the most insane part was, since being on my meds, I'm a lot more stable. But I miss being the way I was. Even though they were supposed to, my meds didn't help my depression. It really just made me more stable. Now without AIDEN or cutting myself or the enjoyment of listening to emo music as I sadistically laugh and cry at the same time, I just feel empty. Though I was completely fucked up, it was still fun a times to laugh at how much I hate myself and my life. Now I can't do those things anymore.

99,How do you feel. What is life with depression? Tell me your story,"To answer your question, I'm actually feeling alright today. Had an existential crisis last night and probably would have ended up killing myself or at the very least cutting myself if it wasn't for my dog licking my hand as I layed in bed crying myself to sleep (she's NEVER an affectionate dog, it took me a minute to even realise that she was actually licking my hand and I wasn't imagining shit). Thanks, Charlie. Anyways, for me depression is like absolute insanity. It's not just sadness or feeling like killing myself every other week. Just pure insanity. The best example I can give is probably two years ago, seventh grade. That was probably the lowest I had ever been. Every night when I went to sleep, I'd stay up on my phone. Not because I wanted to be, because it kept me from going to sleep and having the same nightmares I had every night. And then I'd look at the time, which by now was probably about 12 AM, realise how absolutely sad and pathetic I was and turn on some emo music, usually being something like Set it Off's I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and listen to that as I (literally) sadistically laugh and cry myself to sleep. Some nights, that kind of stuff never happened. I'd have a peaceful sleep. Some nights I'd stay up all night debating whether I should text the suicide hotline, doing so, and it being no help whatsoever. So I'd get, maybe six hours of sleep at most. Before I'm woken up and have to get ready for school. How am I woken up? By my parents during the best part of my dream or the most peaceful part of my nightmare. Which already started my day off terribly. Then for an hour I'd be in the bathroom once again listening to emo music as I let the shower water run. My favourite songs to listen to were usually just about anything by Hollywood Undead. Not something a twelve year old should be listening to, sure. But it was a way to cope with my depression. As I listen to those songs, once again sadistically laughing at my own pain and often times end up cutting myself. I never cut myself deep, I was far to afraid of doing that. But... I enjoyed seeing the blood come out. I didn't cut for any sort of high or release of pain. It was sort of hard to explain. I was never addicted to cutting, I could stop or start whenever I wanted. Sometimes stopping for months at a time, but seeing the blood, made me feel happy. If you could have seen my eyes, especially when I cut myself, you wouldn't have seen any traces of a twelve year old. You'd see an insane person desperately trying to grasp on to the last straw of sanity, but nothing else. Some days I'd debate whether I should do a sort of murder-suicide thing. Or at the very least murder those who have caused me pain and suffering. Sometimes I'd have very and scarily elaborate plans on how I'd trick, kidnap, or kill my family. Things that you'd never expect from a twelve year old. But quite frankly, I might have physically been twelve, but my depression had probably aged and matured me way faster. The ride to school was probably the most traumatic for me. The ride was only about ten minutes (five minutes to school, five minutes in the carpool line). But those ten minutes were full of tests streaming down my face, me punching myself or ripping my hair out, or destroying my notebooks or pencils. Sometimes because I just really didn't want to go to school. Sometimes because my social anxiety got the best of me. Sometimes for reasons I don't even know. Me and my grandma would usually sit at the front of the school for about an hour or two, I'm sitting there trying to find a way to hurt myself because I'm angry, but don't want to let my anger out on her, and she's crying because she's absolutely lost on how to help me. I'd usually end up getting to school about a good three hours late. In school, I don't remember anything. Maybe it's because I was just walking around the school like a robot. Class for an hour, find your next class, repeat. In class, I'd have my head down in a book (not paying attention to the teacher whatsoever), I'd be mindlessly reciting the emo songs I listen to in my head, or I'd be talking to my friend AIDEN. (Yes, his name is in all caps). What I do definitely remember is hating all of my peers. Hell, I still hate them. It's not my hatred for them itself. It's just I can't stand how immature, idiotic, and stupid they were. Like who the hell goes around sticking Tide pods in their mouths for views on social media? Or who thinks it's funny to go around telling people to kill themselves because you heard your favourite edgy YouTuber say it and now you think it's hilarious to do so. Or why do you think it's cool and okay to curse every five seconds and use the N-word? Or why do you think that because you saw Kim Kardashian half naked in some photo shoot that you can show up to school with hardly any clothes on or sag and talk about fucking whores because your favourite rapper said it in their newest song? Act your own god damn age, quit trying to act like someone three times your age while being as immature as a kindergartener. More on AIDEN: AIDEN sort of just appeared out of nowhere. I don't know when or why I came up with him, I just sort of did. I'm not schizophrenic, he was 100% my own voice talking back to me in my head, but I enjoyed pretending to have someone to talk to. Someone who walked around with me everyday, knew exactly what I was thinking, and could relate to me all the time. Someone who (though was just my own voice), talked me out of suicide many times back in 7th grade. But slowly I started treating AIDEN a lot more like a real person. To the point where I could have easily been mistaken as someone with schizophrenia. At home I'd just go into my room and basically lock myself in. My door was never locked, my parents could come in and out as they pleased, but I would just hand out under the covers all day. I didn't want to see light, light didn't want to see me. I didn't bother with homework. I figured, I fail, I fail. I really had just given up with life at that point. The only reason why I hadn't killed myself was probably because I was too sad and lazy to bother trying. Occasionally I'd talk to AIDEN or watch YouTube or something, but most times I ended up listening to hypnosis. Hypnosis for me was like a way to escape real life. Like meditation, but instead of being left alone with my sad and depressing thoughts, I could listen to someone else. At first it was a nice little escape, but then it more or less because an addiction. An odd strange one that I'd never be able to explain to anyone, but an addiction none the less. I'd try to listen to hypnosis any time I could even if that meant going into my room away from family to listen to it. It kind of gave me the same high that cutting, smoking, drugs, or porn give other people. Even though it was just hypnosis, it really did become unhealthy.

You see the effects of social isolation and the lack of control. I work with a person with ABI and as much he tries to stay positive, the frustration seeps out of him all the time.

It's affected my personal life with my relatives because I get so angry thinking about how there is no way to make them better and I lash out for the littlest reasons on them. I understand it's all about perspective but in the already depressed state I'm in, I know I'm not cut out to help other people feel better.

Idk what type of housing you live in (e.g. apt., house, renting, etc.) but that may help cut monthly expenses in some way too if that's something you're looking for. Maybe get a pet if your housing accommodations allow it. Pets really help with loneliness and depression sometimes. People can even actually get their pets registered as official emotional assistance animals. In some cases, they will be allowed to live in certain housing areas in which pets would otherwise not be allowed. Sometimes it's easy to focus on the negative of living alone.

157,"Why is it depressed, suicidal people are told to get help. What if some people are better off dead, and their immediate surrounding world would be better off without them?. Maybe it's an evolutionary thing","They tell you to get help because they don't know what else to do. If they tell you to go on with your suicide, and you do, they don't want that guilt in their life. But if they tell you to get help and it actually works, they can feel good about having helped someone. Helping a depressed person is kind of tricky if you don't really know what depression is like.

178,Last year went poorly in college and I ended up having to repeat the entire academic year. I just showed up to my last Christmas exam today and found out it was on yesterday. I feel like such a failure and want to die.. There's nothing I can do now,"Hey, I know how you feel. Sometimes it's hard to handle daily responsibilities when you're depressed. Everyone fucks up dude. (A practice that is helpful albeit uncomfortable is closing my eyes and breathing, imagining the place that I dread returning to, and picturing myself sitting in there, breathing and at peace. Then I zoom out to the building and picture all the rooms filled with all the other students.. Then I zoom out and picture the exterior... I zoom out and imagine the city view, then the state, then the country, then the hemisphere, then the whole planet, suspended in the I stay there and I just watch it spin slowly. And This puts into perspective that my mistake cannot defeat me.)  I flunked out of college my freshman year and still haven't had the courage to go back, so I commend you for trying again.  And as unsolicited as this is, I gotta say I disagree with the polarizing statement that there isn't anything you can do. You can own your mistake, which you already have. You can brush yourself off and see the mistake in the context of the rest of your life (which is priceless and you are worth so much.) And you can try to do better tomorrow. You are only human. Try and keep your chin up, buddy.

179,Does anyone else avoid human interaction but is simultaneously dying of loneliness?. Ever since I started college it's gotten worse. I'll walk to dining halls at Times I know people who'll recognize me won't be there and when going to class I'll look down with my headphones so they won't greet me. I have no idea why,"I know all too well what you mean. People scare and anger me, have for years, and as a result I don't actually have a single person I would consider a friend and have never had a relationship, but I crave that stuff every night. It causes hard insomnia worrying about if I'll have to be alone forever with no friends or partners to the point I can only sleep out of exhaustion, but then once I have and I wake up the next morning, I'll loathe that I have to go outside and interact with people for work. It's a daily nightmare. I would say that MAYBE, if I gave advice on it, it would be that I used to have a similar thing with shyness, and with that I pushed myself into more and more social situations and now am not so shy. It MAYBE might work the same way with liking/disliking social interaction. But I do that everyday and I still don't like people. I'm more COMFORTABLE around them, but I still don't LIKE them. And it's an entirely different ball park with depression/anxiety than shyness, otherwise if it were so easy to just 'force' yourself to socialize to fix the problem, I'd be doing it myself. If pushing yourself into those situations does help, I hope you find the courage to do it sometime, buddy.",1,0,2,1,0.502252459526062,0.17674310505390167,0.6559895873069763,0.4561164379119873,0.5975321531295776,0.49437159299850464,0.34765151143074036,0.6330402493476868,0.23359842598438263,0.43685948848724365,0.4576430022716522,0.3398931324481964,0.3336704969406128,0.5346001386642456,0.3555606007575989,0.3222202956676483,0.5193832516670227,0.4616343080997467,0.5824868679046631,0.7385445833206177,0,0.5388955473899841,0.23862867057323456,0.5211440324783325,0.32588016986846924,0.5771157741546631,0.3195650577545166,0.4505029618740082,0.5051462054252625,0.20607271790504456,0.4456152617931366,0.5601174235343933,0.3563389778137207,0.5756717920303345,0.6217902898788452,0.4069218635559082,0.2965743839740753,0.5502437949180603,0.5349311828613281,0.7478375434875488,0.8457575440406799

Having depression AND anxiety is a double slam because (in my case) anxiety and depression are almost the same...it's hard to tell the difference. I'm older than dirt and could give you some advice, but I'll just say: try not to be alone and talk to someone that you can be honest with.

190,i dont feel worthy enough to live!?. i literally dont see anything special in me and im a dissapointment. how can i stop feeling this way?,"I often feel the same, but many people don't find their life's purpose until later on in life. Either way the only person whose opinion matters is you, so don't let anyone tell you different. Everyone is unique and doesn't live the same life or the same way! As for how to stop feeling that way, it really depends. Maybe talking about the reasons you feel that way would help? Perhaps trying to try new things and find that thing that makes you feel important, proud, happy, successful, etc. could help.

201,"If I get caught will I end up in a psych ward?. I'm planning on killing myself and was wondering if i somehow survived,would i get put in a psych ward for the rest of my life?","Depends what you mean by get caught. Someone would have to report it to police to move you anywhere or if you're under 18 parents can take you to a hospital. Basic detainment is 72 hours (3 days) To ensure you're not a harm to yourself or others. During that time they examine you and see your mental state. If at the end you're not showing signs of danger you are released but given options to stay for further treatment. If you are still a danger you stay and get more treatment. Now say you made an attempt and go to the ER for something, they can't always just detain you. I've been to the ER for atempt of suicide by oversosing on medication. Longest I was there was a few hours. Due to my mental state being stable they had no legal way to hold me loner than I wanted to be there. I got the drugs out of my system then was discharged and went home. There is a ton, a shit ton of misinformation and propaganda around mental illness. Be informed, do real research. isn't google. You are smart enough to do real research don't just ask strangers online for all the answers.

It feels like a trap,"That is what I thought myself at one point in my life but I was wrong. I took a trip with some friends to Malaysia and Thailand there was high and low points in the trip. The experience I felt was pure happiness and no joking the last time I felt this was when I was a child happy and alive. I noticed what is good and bad in my life, and realized the blessing that I did not notice. It gave me positive momentum even after the trip. Now I am trying to finish my studies and now started seriously training in thai boxing. Recently my psychologist told me that my depression is gone (I can feel the difference) and my anxiety and stress remains high. I made big progress and I am going to make more progress. Basically from my experiences go out and explore. First reflect on your strengths/potential, your interests and the world, then start thinking the necessary steps to live it, even the smallest thing.

Sometimes I have days when I'm so happy I literally shake, and every morning when I wake up feeling my usual shitty self I can't help but wish I was having another one, which just makes everything so much worse I just want to be normal again, instead of feeling like every day is another complete waste of time.",I agree. Last week I had a day where I was so happy and everything was fine. Then one thing didn't go the way I wanted it to and I was crying at work within the next hour... hate feeling like that too.,1,0,2,1,0.4418715238571167,0.17113009095191956,0.5970121622085571,0.403820663690567,0.6152211427688599,0.2847442924976349,0.36851266026496887,0.5189778208732605,0.11758554726839066,0.4266035258769989,0.47269198298454285,0.3204619884490967,0.6736414432525635,0.45511600375175476,0.35513636469841003,0.2343086451292038,0.5549538731575012,0.6111230850219727,0.6961938738822937,0.8726061582565308,0,0.4562491178512573,0.29545238614082336,0.4119458496570587,0.19889803230762482,0.5537595152854919,0.24307061731815338,0.5378745794296265,0.47541776299476624,0.2705855667591095,0.4306789040565491,0.5183762311935425,0.43243104219436646,0.5478739142417908,0.4227876663208008,0.4251038432121277,0.2843475639820099,0.4345160126686096,0.38197559118270874,0.5895777940750122,0.6154747605323792
216,"Ex came back.... I want to go back, I want to feel cared about, but I don't want to be hurt again","My word of advice is just, be careful. If you genuinely feel like you can make it work again, then go for it, but if there's that doubt or feeling that you're going to get hurt again, it might be best to step away. Sometimes you can get back with an ex and it all goes well, but when it doesn't they can get in your head lay their eggs and just dominate every moment of thought.

224,I was gonna as my crush that I’ve liked for 5 yrs to prom..then I find out she already has a date. I wish I a worthless irrelevant piece of shit,"I'm going to sound mean, but I get so tired of hearing this. If you like someone, say something. Don't just like them for years and years, then get upset or feel bad when they get with someone or someone asks them out. I know it's scary and rejection hurts and a million other things, but if you don't say anything, how in the world will someone know your feelings for them? Plus, if she was really your friend, if you asked her out or something, and she stopped talking to you or humiliated you for that, then she wasn't a good friend, anyway, and you'd be better off without her.

295,"Do any of you guys feel like me?. For some background, I'm 18 and in my freshman year of university. For a couple months now I've just been feeling sorta weird. It's like a long funk. I don't know how to describe it. If I had to choose, I'd say I feel empty or indifferent. I'm still able to laugh and find things funny, but a lot of the time I just feel like a machine, doing things because I have to. My motivation is minimal. A part of me is just not transitioning very well from high school to university. I don't like it here and I don't know how to describe it, either. Maybe out of place? Not fitting in? The environment here is just cold. I've been looking forward to sleeping more lately, but I dunno if that's just my exhaustion from late night studying/work or something else. I think I failed my chemistry exam and the course and it doesn't really phase me. I don't know what's wrong. Am I depressed? Do you guys feel similarly?","Sounds like apathy to me. I'm guessing you feel kind of lost and without a direction and you just are following the path that you feel is required of you. While apathy is one symptom of depression, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have depression. By no means am I downplaying depression or trying to convince you that nothing is wrong because there isn't any on true definition of depression. I felt like you for a while, just a few small pleasures but nothing really else. For me, it went away after a few months. If you want to talk about it more or anything, feel free to ask anything. My only advice is don't give up now, because if it goes away, you'll regret a lot of things that you stopped caring about.",1,0,2,1,0.48896273970603943,0.21557258069515228,0.5452327728271484,0.3864021301269531,0.5421260595321655,0.23507095873355865,0.3750786781311035,0.5950299501419067,0.19565920531749725,0.39834874868392944,0.5166230797767639,0.3347189724445343,0.6546540260314941,0.5681368708610535,0.32647705078125,0.10346536338329315,0.5473193526268005,0.5929816365242004,0.6843839883804321,0.534964382648468,0,0.4448171555995941,0.1837705373764038,0.5808994770050049,0.3878917694091797,0.5576785802841187,0.23914645612239838,0.3578512370586395,0.5893915891647339,0.1956087201833725,0.4411385953426361,0.5203970074653625,0.3037467300891876,0.6846522092819214,0.5768086314201355,0.3211071789264679,0.22467397153377533,0.5464920997619629,0.6402171850204468,0.7144302725791931,0.7342139482498169
296,Any tips for improved self esteem?. My self esteem is honestly so low it may as well not exist. Any help on improving it would be great.,"When my depression was at its worst, I was lost as to what would make me feel better. I thought about what the kid version of me would think was impressive if the adult version of me actually did it. I remembered I'd always been fascinated by the seemingly impossible idea of doing a triathlon. I signed up for an Olympic distance one (way way less than an Ironman but still seemed like an almost impossible feat for me at the time) and 6 months later, I crossed the finish line. It felt good to complete and it felt good to be healthier than I'd ever been. Being fit and healthy is going to help manage depression, (/r/eood and /r/fitness are both great places) but maybe that's not your bag. Can you think of any goal that you have now (or one you can resurrect from the past) that you KNOW you'd feel great about completing?",0,2,2,1,0.5289612412452698,0.4635826051235199,0.5075125098228455,0.20806951820850372,0.3647180199623108,0.2851080596446991,0.522526204586029,0.6062473654747009,0.6052454113960266,0.5347687005996704,0.5309433937072754,0.458642840385437,0.48653727769851685,0.5274054408073425,0.4479840397834778,0.21042665839195251,0.37460848689079285,0.5598123073577881,0.6531016826629639,0.40420833230018616,0,0.4471341371536255,0.26249632239341736,0.5504282712936401,0.34504178166389465,0.5036090612411499,0.24873672425746918,0.4029445946216583,0.5918628573417664,0.465395450592041,0.4312889575958252,0.518446147441864,0.2951533794403076,0.6705333590507507,0.6343620419502258,0.3271147310733795,0.12353034317493439,0.48877668380737305,0.6145603060722351,0.7516212463378906,0.5010822415351868

After I returned to work, a fellow colleague asked where had I been and I accordingly told him. He then said, not everyone hates I am so glad.","Hm. I think they were just trying to make an off-hand joke or something. Sometimes (most of the time) co-workers berate each other. It's all banter most of the time. But if he took the time and interest to ask where you've been, I don't think he hates you. I understand why it upsets you, people like us, most people with depression, hang on to the little negative things throughout their day that most people brush off, and they eat away at us. But I want you to know, that it's okay. If it really made you uncomfortable, confront him / her about it. Or talk to HR if you want. Or your boss, or whomever. But don't hold a grudge against him / her. They most likely just didn't know how it would affect you. :c But das okay, because we're all here for you ^-^",1,0,2,1,0.4722287356853485,0.38939666748046875,0.5734209418296814,0.278464138507843,0.45250311493873596,0.29569458961486816,0.3802836239337921,0.6622459888458252,0.40962672233581543,0.4912799298763275,0.521820604801178,0.509574830532074,0.563839852809906,0.7078601121902466,0.4075562655925751,0.27289119362831116,0.4262211322784424,0.4716331958770752,0.6217410564422607,0.5940603613853455,0,0.614501416683197,0.08929422497749329,0.4809798002243042,0.47053083777427673,0.6129140257835388,0.20423197746276855,0.3341161906719208,0.583471417427063,0.1152338832616806,0.4160592555999756,0.4888354539871216,0.26103532314300537,0.5857788324356079,0.6502925753593445,0.3730541169643402,0.18380412459373474,0.629105269908905,0.5694765448570251,0.6320277452468872,0.8391956686973572

311,"mirtazapine increase to 30 mg after 2 days of 15mg?. i wonna take mirtazapine for adhd / lack of motivation / depression, so i thought 30mg in the morning would be nice. it has been only 2 days since i started from 15. can i already up to 30mg? what would be downsides?","Mirtazapine as far as I know is used for depression/insomnia typically. Not for adhd. I would ask your doctor about vyvance or another drug similar to that for your adhd... mirtazapine is perfectly fine to go from that dose to 30 in my opinion. It would be better if your body was introduced longer to the 15mg (2weeks) then bumped up to 30mg, but I see no complications or issues with being bumped up to 30mg this early in the game. Side effects of Mirtazapine are that it will make you tired, so the motivation and everything may be an issue with your adhd... Again look into vyvance. You may gain some weight also, that is a common side effect. Also some anxiety could occur, but that is rare. important to read up on your meds when you receive new ones. Or ask your doctor before you even get prescribed them.",0,0,0,1,0.4555495083332062,0.4361083507537842,0.5220357775688171,0.2122635841369629,0.45948269963264465,0.3469995856285095,0.44601166248321533,0.4717932641506195,0.4027777910232544,0.4763890504837036,0.4726393520832062,0.43026965856552124,0.475881427526474,0.4500604569911957,0.37173905968666077,0.22443342208862305,0.2919612228870392,0.485314279794693,0.6415448188781738,0.430864542722702,0,0.4518069624900818,0.2709510922431946,0.5584350824356079,0.34840381145477295,0.46375182271003723,0.2552708089351654,0.29727670550346375,0.6116513609886169,0.248954638838768,0.3991970717906952,0.541180431842804,0.3861098289489746,0.6530047059059143,0.5720019936561584,0.27155447006225586,0.11910323798656464,0.4866454601287842,0.5646719932556152,0.7052049040794373,0.480388879776001

I've even started paying people to care like going to the hair dresser to get a wash and cut even though I don't need one or going to the chiropractor even though it doesn't help but for 15 minutes it's almost like someone cares.,0,0,2,1,0.508145809173584,0.1864423006772995,0.5228285789489746,0.4672832489013672,0.5219930410385132,0.21314455568790436,0.28468382358551025,0.7046686410903931,0.2503567039966583,0.4854094982147217,0.4455846846103668,0.3747440576553345,0.5189201235771179,0.8024510145187378,0.3289991617202759,0.22266961634159088,0.5732791423797607,0.6097397804260254,0.6278003454208374,0.7246029376983643,0,0.5462119579315186,0.21789774298667908,0.5112608075141907,0.3305725157260895,0.5351262092590332,0.27949172258377075,0.380201131105423,0.5743989944458008,0.21918535232543945,0.4648933410644531,0.5738592743873596,0.4933667778968811,0.5032802224159241,0.5785231590270996,0.4166812002658844,0.28004390001296997,0.4677429795265198,0.46652504801750183,0.6420866250991821,0.7359734177589417

326,I want to give up.. So very badly. I've ruined everything good in my life. I can't take this pain anymore. I want it to stop. I want to be dead. This is too much. I can't undo my stupidity and now I'm fucked. I can't do this.,"I have been at a similar point to you where I had suicidal ideations on a daily basis and to be honest, even when aspects in my life have improved, I still struggle with it frequently. I have done many things in life I regret and feel like I've fucked up a lot of situations, relationships and opportunities in both my personal and professional life. It took me a long time to understand that I can't go back in time and fix anything. It is fucking terrifying to feel like you've messed your life up but please trust me when I say that it's ok to fuck up. You are human. We all are.

I have to get up and go to school and work because depending on me with his tiny little life. I have to get up period because he needs breakfast in the morning. I have to keep going because he loves me and his person and no one to care for him if gone. So I suck it up and I do it for him. Plus a great cuddle partner when I cry and I have to sleep alone anymore. I also started walking him, like on a leash like a crazy person walking him. I got him because he was trapped inside my moms car and had a lifelong fear of cars. Whenever he hears one he panics and tries to hide and gets himself stuck places. But he also loves to be outside. So I walk the little guy on a leash. And he gets to go outside and I have to exercise. Half the time we end up down the block sitting in the middle of the sidewalk with him curled up panicked in my lap because he heard a car, but hey were outside.

376,"Looking for advice. I have been in a recently. I been to work in 2 weeks and have just been extremely depressed &amp; anxious. I am basically sick of this and ready to make a change but I know where to start. I have major issues opening up to a therapist and have tried numerous times and constantly fail. I am taking meds for the depression and anxiety, but basically think what taking is enough. Does anyone have advice on different coping tactics you use throughout the day to get yourself past the extreme feelings of anxiety? Any other advice on positive or motivational changes I could consider? Willing to try basically anything at this point...","I feel pretty anxious myself. But when i have no choice I just come to the point where i think what's the worse that could happen? maybe I faint. But then there are people to help me. If I panic I can just excuse myself and leave. If the situation gets to much, I can leave anytime. And just knowing that I am always in controll of what I am doing helps me a lot. Having trouble in the subway? Well, you can pull the breaks anytime. That's pretty expensive and affects a lot of people but just knowing that I could is a big plus. I am not a prisoner in these situations. I am free. I can leave whenever I want. But sometimes I realize I panic because of no logical reason. I tell that myself. Than I make a breathing exercise and it calms down. My therapist told me, when you have the feeling of not getting enough air breath through a straw. It calms you down, makes you hear your breath and you start focussing on it. &amp;#x200B; I hope that helped &amp;#x200B;",0,0,2,1,0.5377296209335327,0.3889237642288208,0.478728711605072,0.2106829583644867,0.4304264485836029,0.25412702560424805,0.43832793831825256,0.558732807636261,0.392842173576355,0.4336588382720947,0.5575736165046692,0.3800444006919861,0.5295838713645935,0.43578529357910156,0.36310014128685,0.22626037895679474,0.4460693299770355,0.5840579271316528,0.6292372941970825,0.5014800429344177,0,0.4721188545227051,0.17153896391391754,0.47771185636520386,0.42030978202819824,0.5161550641059875,0.2730478048324585,0.41383057832717896,0.5051589608192444,0.14546705782413483,0.31776493787765503,0.40673932433128357,0.322173535823822,0.6096214056015015,0.4007892608642578,0.3008158504962921,0.11360828578472137,0.525355875492096,0.6477133631706238,0.6286791563034058,0.6324569582939148

378,I love you.. I may not know you personally but I want to say I love you. I almost committed suicide this last year. If you do decide to commit Suicide I won't be mad I don't know what your going through. I know sometimes the thought of nothingness sounds like a purgatory you'd want to live because that's better than the current hell your living. I was taken to the hospital and I've been through inpatient and out patient care. Zoloft and out patient care have been working for me so far. It's ok to be content to be slightly forlorn. If anyone needs me feel free to message me. If you suspect you have depression or have Suicidal thoughts or actions. Talk to your doctor. My therapist tells me to make plans to hold myself accountable to go out. I won't tell you you need a god or give you advice. I'm content with loving you and grieving with you if you need that. Depression is strange and terrible because you don't always know why your grieving. That's ok. Most of all I want to tell you I love you.,"Dear Anna_rampage. Thank you for your kind words.

417,I feel worthless. My gf cheated on me twice. I feel worthless. It has destroyed my self-esteem.,"Sorry to hear that. Obviously a very painful experience. Of course you're not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person, but to get through this life you'll really want to get to the place where you understand other people's behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you. I'm not trying to suggest some stupid mind-trick here, of course when someone chooses another person over you, you are going to have thoughts of worthlessness and insecurity. But even if someone you are with realizes they'd rather be with someone else, it doesn't require them to cheat on you, they could just be an adult and end a relationship before doing something behind someone's back. Human love is fickle. There's no way to ever say that anyone who decides to spend time with you owes it to you to honor that choice forever, but it certainly doesn't mean they have to cheat and lie. This advice has stuck with me ever since I heard it on a podcast; don't ever expect other human beings to be rational, or to assume they are playing by the same set of rules and understandings as you are. They lived so much of their lives before you were ever it in, you have no idea if this behavior could be a reflection of something somebody else did to them in their past or whatever. You can't blame yourself for other people. Otherwise a total stranger could walk up to you on the street and punch you, and you'll spend the next week wondering what you did wrong instead of identifying that person as a violent crazy person. Regardless, it isn't exactly the most logical part of your mind that is going to feel rotten about this for a while, so no amount of information is going to make it feel better right away. But try to love yourself, and work on coming around to that understanding that other people's choices do not say anything about you, only about them. This action means that they are a cheater, not that you are worthless.",2,0,0,1,0.48801201581954956,0.1510288566350937,0.6440699696540833,0.3907582461833954,0.6269394755363464,0.34899353981018066,0.44082018733024597,0.5576618909835815,0.07142403721809387,0.5554848909378052,0.5238820314407349,0.4940156638622284,0.5747506618499756,0.6384997367858887,0.38767102360725403,0.24030865728855133,0.5791425108909607,0.6326915621757507,0.7205697298049927,0.929961085319519,0,0.4839789569377899,0.21465423703193665,0.5486118793487549,0.5122044682502747,0.5238027572631836,0.28284764289855957,0.26087674498558044,0.5907368659973145,0.19253891706466675,0.42383962869644165,0.5113545656204224,0.2709663510322571,0.5516069531440735,0.6864094734191895,0.3170669674873352,0.12158036231994629,0.6635639667510986,0.5074845552444458,0.780290961265564,0.7321586608886719

422,How do I know if I have clinical depression?. I just feel shitty all the time even though the reasons are tiny and petty,"Sometimes the reasons for having depression are irrelevant. If your gut instincts are telling you you may be depressed, then there could be some truth to it. At this stage you should be seeking treatments and seeing if you notice any differences in how you feel. I'd recommend running outdoors for 45 minutes at least 5 times a week. This is actually more powerful than antidepressant medication and without unhealthy side effects - on the contrary - it strengthens connections in the brain which are responsible for feeling good.

428,"First time using anti depressant pills and feel really energized, hyped and my whole body is shaking is this normal?. I use 100 mg Sertalin and I am 17 yo","Yup. In my experience sertraline was more intense than (es)citalopram the first few days and I started slow at like 12.5mg. It's really the first week - actually about the first 4 days - effect. The thing that requires the black box warning because it's a surprise if no one tells you to expect it (and not everyone gets it so powerfully). If it's too intense talk to your doctor about cutting back and moving up slower (I've settled on 50mg and that was after titrating up). Try splitting it up into at least two doses so it doesn't all hit you at once - sertraline's got a relatively short serum life and I'm preferring a morning and afternoon dose. ... and during this 'jittery' period try to take it at least 4 hours before bed so you'll have a shot at getting some proper sleep. It gets a *lot* more boring (but still potentially helpful) once your body adapts! Right now all sorts of stuff is going on with your serotonin and it's pretty much the 'psychedelic' part. Once your system adjusts the idea is that the drug is holding a 'buffer' of serotonin in the synapses so it's there when you need it for more even moods and less discomfort, but until that settles down it can be pretty trippy and stimulating (especially with sertraline that has a nice extra dopamine stimulatory effect, which is pretty helpful offsetting some of the more annoying SSRI side effects in the longer term). So if you feel like you're going to jump out of your skin now - yeah, that's normal, and it passes in about those 4-7 days (for me, anyway). Also heads-up that.. yeah, with sertraline, those days included a lot of nausea and (ahem) intense GI effects for me too - that passes too.",0,0,2,1,0.5165270566940308,0.5473665595054626,0.5366239547729492,0.07271765172481537,0.3920949399471283,0.34587472677230835,0.5827183723449707,0.3788168132305145,0.48602932691574097,0.5319277048110962,0.47872868180274963,0.5192214846611023,0.5041342377662659,0.4632419943809509,0.45210421085357666,0.2802729904651642,0.3042251169681549,0.5535339713096619,0.5056477189064026,0.45181912183761597,0,0.40935635566711426,0.15454652905464172,0.5188843011856079,0.33214834332466125,0.4962361752986908,0.2741597890853882,0.2876584529876709,0.5030006170272827,0.18521545827388763,0.34129053354263306,0.48746970295906067,0.21068860590457916,0.6632194519042969,0.43884092569351196,0.1842758059501648,-0.0431252159178257,0.4385019838809967,0.6378726363182068,0.6365338563919067,0.45411059260368347

459,"I constantly feel morally and intellectually superior to everyone around me, but with no evidence to back up these feelings.. Like, I'll look around me as I sit in lectures or walk around the university campus and think to myself these people are just so stupid, they understand nothing, they're so shallow and empty-headed, and I feel 100% confident in being right, but then I'll try to logically think about why I'm superior (and I'm also 100% certain that I *am* superior), and I come up with nothing. In any quantifiable measure of superiority, I always fail. And yet, I can't shake this feeling that everyone else is inferior to me. I think maybe it's just a gut reaction because of how unhappy and depressed I am, but I don't know. I know that I probably sound like a complete asshole to anyone reading this, but it's how I honestly feel.","Maybe it's a defense mechanism you created when you were a child?

What I found is that volunteering is a great stepping stone on the path to getting a job and being more comfortable around people. Volunteer gigs are pretty easy to find and land, and the people who also volunteer tend to be nice people as well. If that's something interesting to you, call up your local churches and ask about volunteering opportunities.

They will be there at all times for you, and you for them. Who knows, they even migth help you find a partner! 2- Go and meet new people. I know its hard, but if you want to find love, do it. Get to know people. Talk to them, be their friends. If you have any party or any event, go. You will eventually find someone that likes you, and you like her. Also, don't look for sex. You will never fuck on the first date, and sex is not the only thing that matters in life. Would you fuck a doll with no feelings? Always talk with girls with the mentality that you won't have sex with them. Gurls also feel love. 3- Keep living with your pillow.

525,Can someone who has been through depression describe what it is like to be done with it?. I just want to know what awaits us one day.,"I saw your post several hours ago and I've been thinking all afternoon about what you asked. I'm not sure if I can fully explain the shift I made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person I am now. There was a whole series of decisions and lessons and realizations I've made over a period of several years which probably merits its own post (or series of them). I joined this a short time ago and have been sort of lurking, trying to understand this community and seeing if I have anything to contribute, and your post makes me realize that maybe just telling my story will help others make their own way on their journey. To answer your specific question, the one thing I have come to understand is that there really isn't going to be a time when you are entirely done with it. There will always be a chance, however small, that you can fall back into it. However the longer you go without falling back in, the easier it gets. I tend to think of it in terms of black holes and orbital bodies. I'm going to have to create a post on that. The truths I've found is that recovery and freedom from depression is about breaking habitual negative lines of thought by replacing it with more positive ones. It's about learning how to recognize when you are falling back into the pit of depression, and being able to pull yourself back out. It's about accepting and finding value in yourself, and finding many many reasons to continue to be alive, to contribute and interact with the rest of the world. Coming from the other side, I understand so many things that I used to see as negative really don't have any sort of positive or negative connotation. That was all in my head. Often those negative connotations were put there by others, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes deliberately. I had to learn how to strip those ideas off and choose a new set of ideas to assign. I learned how to identify what kind of ideas were worth keeping and using, and which ones were not and discard them. I know this doesn't really explain much how I see things now, and how I no longer feel depressed all the time, but I promise to share my story in the hopes of helping you understand how I got where I am, and maybe help you make a similar journey.",0,0,2,1,0.470701664686203,0.24711556732654572,0.6041449904441833,0.3504126965999603,0.4638466536998749,0.3812011182308197,0.2926007807254791,0.6660981178283691,0.44126662611961365,0.48897647857666016,0.46422460675239563,0.4058201313018799,0.5388595461845398,0.5969892740249634,0.33107155561447144,0.29133152961730957,0.43050846457481384,0.5329878330230713,0.6400661468505859,0.5479110479354858,0,0.5112965106964111,0.18066775798797607,0.4139566719532013,0.31687143445014954,0.3638971149921417,0.2865815758705139,0.4646684229373932,0.4862488806247711,0.39638182520866394,0.4142506718635559,0.6038068532943726,0.33841395378112793,0.5890939235687256,0.5577685236930847,0.3273825943470001,0.04820934310555458,0.43511343002319336,0.6229976415634155,0.8135689496994019,0.4742391109466553

535,I am hurting my family by existing. I am just a burden to them that is always ruining everything.,"I often feel the same. But you know, your parents are human beings too. They will eventually hurt you one day by saying something or doing something wrong... it's normal. But it is your family and they love you and you love them. So you can forgive them and try to understand what happened and why it happened. Then, you can try to make it never happens again. If you're depressed it's not your fault. If you are sick it's not your fault either. They want to help you because you're their child. It's normal for them to help you and you don't have to pay them back for that. Don't be too hard on you. You seem like nice person !

581,"Is it supposed to be like this?. had depression since I was probably around 14. 38 now and I recall a time when I depressed. Off meds my bouts of deep depression were much sharper it seems. On meds it seems like everything is dulled. Perhaps my age (and the fact that just sick of everyday life in general) that seems to have dulled life experience, maybe the seemingly constant barrage of tragedies and heavy personal baggage, but it seems like my doctors are just barely keeping me functional. It feels like psychological life-support. My question is, is this what meds are supposed to be? Just little bumpers to keep you from falling off the deep end? Do people take meds and actually experience...happiness in their life? Now asked this question to people (whom I know also take meds) straight to their face and I get a distinct feeling like being lied to as they tell me that they know what I mean, or that happy because they have a great family or whatever. But what are these meds really supposed to DO?",I feel the same way you do and would also like an answer to this question part of me want to stop taking them and fall off the deep end again im tired of putting on an act for my family because if I show them how I feel the tell me I need more meds,1,0,2,1,0.4453495144844055,0.21760550141334534,0.5647552609443665,0.41722145676612854,0.55227130651474,0.24303646385669708,0.3310816287994385,0.6067308187484741,0.25109270215034485,0.4357367753982544,0.510166585445404,0.38928350806236267,0.6046294569969177,0.5660266876220703,0.3153702914714813,0.2083640992641449,0.5234514474868774,0.5461533069610596,0.7227628827095032,0.732031524181366,0,0.5645226240158081,0.3975115716457367,0.6235228776931763,0.1804523468017578,0.4532070457935333,0.4247543215751648,0.5348722338676453,0.6012603640556335,0.3697265386581421,0.5144547820091248,0.6152123808860779,0.6394146084785461,0.5062729716300964,0.7021316885948181,0.4672733545303345,0.566807210445404,0.3203352689743042,0.5799838304519653,0.6176778078079224,0.691275417804718

612,Why people desire to have children. World is a nasty place. Life is terrible. Why would you let someone come through the same shit?,"I wanted to have a kid for selfish reasons, I wanted a reason to live and I wanted someone who understood me. I feel like no one in this world can understand me and therefore no one is willing to put up with me, if I had a kid I could raise them the way I was raised and they would have the same genetics as I so I feel like they would have a chance of understanding me. Also it's pretty much a guaranteed way of having a companion for 18 years, and if you play your cards right it's someone who will tend to you in your old age and sit with you as you die. All that being said you'll notice I used past tense wanted instead of want and that's because I got hit with several physical illnesses that make it near impossible for me to have a kid (or even take care of a kid) and even if I were miraculously cured tomorrow I wouldn't want to risk passing on these illnesses and causing someone to suffer as much as I have suffered.",0,0,2,1,0.4615883529186249,0.1716899573802948,0.6599491834640503,0.4659304916858673,0.6001880168914795,0.35078364610671997,0.1268240213394165,0.7178763151168823,0.1393192857503891,0.46934282779693604,0.47371816635131836,0.3676374852657318,0.5607293248176575,0.7533648014068604,0.23681016266345978,0.20492608845233917,0.5587718486785889,0.5114064812660217,0.6972509026527405,0.8517149090766907,0,0.4110121726989746,0.2596396803855896,0.586077868938446,0.3702838718891144,0.5272572040557861,0.2582218050956726,0.4144304692745209,0.6569449305534363,0.21407203376293182,0.3973291516304016,0.505150318145752,0.3132985234260559,0.7211854457855225,0.5863452553749084,0.3401060700416565,0.28833362460136414,0.5657459497451782,0.6281224489212036,0.7315534949302673,0.7030733227729797

I think the best way is to sometimes look at yourself like you are a close friend and treat yourself accordingly.

623,"Post-suicide Questions I Wanted to Ask. I started writing my letters today and I wondered how people would receive them if they were electronic. These letters arent really something I can handwrite in a timely manner without having the courage to keep writing. Do the police access the computer and shift through the belongings to find the letters or wouls I have to send them out myself to have them delivered? What happens to my belongings? If I lock myself in a nonshared dorm room and kill myself, how long would it take to find my body and who would be responsible for cleaning it up? Would it leave my family in debt? Would blowing my head off or hanging myself leave my body in a state where it's unusable for a funeral? I'm turning 20 in 2 months and I'm just too tired. Id like to finally be able to rest and not have to live a conitant life of fear and sadness. As much as I do not want to keep living this kind of life, I am too tired to keep pushing through any longer and I'd just like for my death to be somewhat feasible for my mom and sibling.","the thing, though, your death be feasible. Your mom and sibling would spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was something they did or said that pushed you over the edge, or thinking about what they could have done differently to be there for you. One of both of them would likely spiral into a depression of their own. I used to think that no one would miss me much if I killed myself, but always remember the sound of my brothers voice when he found me with blood pouring from my arm. That something that you can just get over. Even leaving notes really help the pain for your family. Also consider the suffering of the people who found you. It could be an RA or a dorm mate. They would be traumatized for life, with severe PTSD from seeing a dead, decomposing body. That point would be too late for you to do anything, so we try not to let it go that far. get me wrong, I know where coming from, and not trying to make you feel bad for would be wrong. And clear from the fact that even thinking about these things that you have some reservations, so build on that. Take every little good thing that happens to you and imagine never feeling that way again, and imagine robbing the people you love of those feelings as well. Forgive me for being brash, but there is absolutely nothing delicate or glorious about suicide. The people who experience it secondhand go through ten times the suffering of the people who commit it. Please, for the sake of a stranger on the internet who cares about you, think again.

631,How do some people get so lucky?. How do some people get lucky enough they don't get depressed and seem to live active healthy happy lives? It's like a curse of chance your either lucky enough to not have it come down on your or your one of the unfortunate ones to have it happen.,"I think it's a matter of perspective. Bad things happen to everyone, but how you react makes a difference. I don't see the point of complaining. If I'm upset or feel like I've been dealt a bad hand, I look for a solution. In the past, I used to beat myself up over all my screw ups or when I felt I wasn't treated right. I realize now that everyone goes through the same type of things and you can't fight them. Adults have the same issues with heartbreak and money trouble as teens, the only difference is they think they're experienced. No one is experienced. Everything that happens to you is the first time that unique situation happened to your unique person. Your reaction is the only thing that changes how these events affect you. I know it's generalizing a bit, but if only good things happen to happy people, it's because those people tend to focus on the good things that happen to them and view the bad things that happen as an obstacle that they need to overcome. They don't wallow.

633,Satisfaction from helping others. realised that when I have to much alone time is when I start to think things over and get awful anxiety or feelings of depression. So therefore if anyone would like a chat or just someone to listen to them here,"Helping someone else is often an achievement. - Even if we don't actually help them, we go to the effort to actually do something, with effort, thought, compassion and eagerness to do good. - When everything is hard to do, because C R I P P P I N G D E P R E S S I O N, let us count very victory no matter how small it may feel. Achievements help us to feel a little less shitty - we did a thing! Yay But also when we help others we help ourselves. - We remind ourselves to be positive, we read commends and upboat new ideas, where we may even add them to our own ideology. - To learn about the struggles of others we feel indifferent which is comforting - maybe we arnt as weird and broken as we tell ourselves?

I wish I could find a way. I know I've lived through some stuff that still weighs on me and I know that time helps to ease the pain, but it's really difficult to keep it together sometimes; and being unable to enjoy the little things of each day makes it frustrating in some way. I hope that you'll find a way around it!",1,0,2,1,0.5192812085151672,0.19655008614063263,0.5863179564476013,0.307721883058548,0.4292949438095093,0.1988605409860611,0.2876516878604889,0.563103199005127,0.24146229028701782,0.3603028953075409,0.4407484233379364,0.29813098907470703,0.45385444164276123,0.4943688213825226,0.4937913417816162,0.28513872623443604,0.43922609090805054,0.2955583930015564,0.45222508907318115,0.5508419871330261,0,0.4671972990036011,0.21573232114315033,0.5872724056243896,0.3619459867477417,0.538303792476654,0.25463736057281494,0.4109228849411011,0.5597540736198425,0.22546564042568207,0.4050045609474182,0.516153872013092,0.31252437829971313,0.6327534914016724,0.5664283633232117,0.3753264844417572,0.2276095449924469,0.4780961573123932,0.6259588003158569,0.7179903388023376,0.6766929030418396

650,The only problem left when you find the cure.... You don't have the energy to employ it.,"The cure is less stress and ways to de-stress. Then your brain will start operating better. Why? Because you don't have energy, focus, clear thoughts, motivation and thousand other things precisely because of too much stress that got out of hand and you can't handle it anymore. I'll give you one example. Do you know what happens when there is too much cortisol? Look up high cortisol symptoms.

658,"Even when I'm having a good day, I feel guilty about feeling normal, and come here to drag myself down a little.. It's like I enjoy feeling sad and lethargic. Being happy makes me uncomfortable for whatever reason, so I suppress it, and every time I do, I get better and better at it... I don't understand why I do this.","Yep, this is pretty common. Usually when you've been depressed for a long time, it starts to become a part of your identity. I assume normal people feel a range of unpredictable emotions throughout the day, but the state of depression is pretty unchanging and there's a comfort that comes from feeling sad/numb/apathetic all day/week/month. I used to fight my depression and look for things to make me happy...when I realized it was all meaningless, I gave into my depression and it's now my closest friend. As sick as it sounds, I wouldn't want to lose it.",0,0,1,1,0.5575444102287292,0.2867860794067383,0.421732634305954,0.29453787207603455,0.527656078338623,0.19954530894756317,0.7247072458267212,0.5743240714073181,0.24620629847049713,0.5303084254264832,0.516768217086792,0.4760951101779938,0.509504497051239,0.48647335171699524,0.4921902120113373,0.22424045205116272,0.47680237889289856,0.5669199228286743,0.6689891815185547,0.6815120577812195,0,0.44984766840934753,0.1856984794139862,0.5586119294166565,0.3718128800392151,0.5530333518981934,0.27582019567489624,0.35847267508506775,0.5674369931221008,0.17079490423202515,0.41126444935798645,0.4944913983345032,0.33303603529930115,0.6523171067237854,0.5312409400939941,0.3679823577404022,0.25013887882232666,0.5289761424064636,0.6140824556350708,0.7020799517631531,0.8197154402732849

664,"I don't know how to continue anymore. I'm 24 years old now. Always had suicidal thoughts all my life. Due to being bullied in school. Due to not having friends in highschool. Failure after failure in college. I never gave up. And then I was diagnosed with herniated disc which caused me pain for the last two years. Sciatica in my right leg all the time and also in my left leg at times. And I'm going bald which is giving me a lot of confidence problems. And now like the cherry on top , I've been diagnosed with cervical disc problem. Just don't know what to do anymore. I'm 23, how the hell am I supposed to live the rest of my natural life in pain everyday. And the average life span in my family is almost 90 years. My family doesn't seem to understand how bad my pain is. My dad understood it when he saw me limping due to pain in my legs. But my mom and the rest of the family always trivializes it. They call me lazy when I try to take rest in bed . She won't understand no matter how many times I explain it.","I'm so sorry to hear about your situation--that's a really difficult thing to have to endure, especially with your family's lack of understanding. I don't think you should give up the possibility of finding relief for your pain--even if there is not a reliable treatment now, pain relief is a major area of medical science research. (Is medical marijuana legal where you live, or if not is it a possibility to move to where it is?) You might find support and recommendations at r/sciatica Hang in there. I would strongly recommend trying to talk to a therapist if that's an option. Otherwise, it seems to me the other most important thing you can do is to try to find work or an activity, paid or unpaid, that is meaningful to you (if movement is an issue, look up online opportunities) which will help you get your mind off of your pain.",2,2,0,1,0.40620556473731995,0.24708972871303558,0.6112378835678101,0.3056953251361847,0.599705696105957,0.3013995885848999,0.39066118001937866,0.5510318279266357,0.14118051528930664,0.4511164128780365,0.5603355169296265,0.3590446710586548,0.6523967385292053,0.5232905745506287,0.3295324742794037,0.2529013752937317,0.5553808808326721,0.6373707056045532,0.6964690685272217,0.8005086183547974,0,0.41748863458633423,0.16932673752307892,0.5729095339775085,0.3852038085460663,0.5224040746688843,0.24678780138492584,0.266616553068161,0.6034536957740784,0.14727820456027985,0.38511916995048523,0.49806302785873413,0.285314679145813,0.6874545216560364,0.5656082630157471,0.2545609772205353,0.1642204076051712,0.5389421582221985,0.6138216257095337,0.6968201398849487,0.6862471699714661

669,"Wellbutrin XL and Psilocybin. I have been taking Wellbutrin for my depression. (150 mg. of XL) for about 3 months now. It seems to have helped, a little. So I'm wondering if I should ask my doctor to increase the dosage to see if it helps, a little more. Has this helped anyone else? If so, how can you tell how much of an increase you need? Will taking it at different times of the day help instead of an increase in dosage? Say 75 mg. in the AM and 75 mg. PM? Also, I am curious about micro dosing with Psilocybin for my depression (magic mushrooms). I've read a lot of interesting and positive results from people using it for depression. I'm curious if anyone with depression has experience with Psilocybin while also taking Wellbutrin, and if so what was the affect? Also, has anyone stopped taking their Wellbutrin *completely*, in exchange for micro dosing with Psilocybin?",52 and never used street drugs but Id be first in line to try mushrooms if there was a trial or if they become legal.

Why can't someone just give me an honest answer.,"You say you'll never be able to move out . . . sure you will! would you be moving to a new city or some where farther away? obviously, to move out, you will need a good paying job and money for an apt (by your self or with roommates.) tell your family that you are moving out on X date, if you are over 18, they can't really do anything about it. tell the police that you are moving away and your family is triggering your depression. they might try to file a missing person report if they notice that you go missing out of no where. suicide, I don't think, is ever the answer.",1,2,0,1,0.434772253036499,0.2040541172027588,0.5980693697929382,0.3625408411026001,0.5569601058959961,0.30750444531440735,0.3942817747592926,0.654611349105835,0.1848708838224411,0.5138235092163086,0.4646211862564087,0.40453988313674927,0.5537684559822083,0.6368106603622437,0.3069722652435303,0.1694856882095337,0.5641340017318726,0.5761762857437134,0.6368513107299805,0.6705836057662964,0,0.4189017713069916,0.22661809623241425,0.5169075727462769,0.39788109064102173,0.4946194589138031,0.24379001557826996,0.27086836099624634,0.5800232887268066,0.26934027671813965,0.39837801456451416,0.5422291159629822,0.315886914730072,0.6147613525390625,0.6974006295204163,0.2855534255504608,0.2491348534822464,0.5932399034500122,0.6147685647010803,0.7074548006057739,0.6829990148544312
676,Anyone have theories on what exactly causes depression?. I have seen people who have shitty lives and while they might be unhappy they don't seem to carry severe symptoms of depression. There must be some other factor. What do you guys think?,Being unhappy with yourself; Abusive relationship; death of a loved one. Inspiration to be a better person has curbed the drive to end my life.

Go find some therapist then wait to be referred to a psychiatrist? Who do I call?","Here's the simplest way I can think of: 1- Go to your primary care doctor and report your symptoms of depression. Ask to be referred to a psychiatrist. If you can immediately see a psychiatrist, go for that. 2- Get into therapy, it really helps. Use psychology today to find good caregivers in your area.

All i can say is that you will met people that will stay with you and understand at some point but it takes effort and time, it took me some time. I hope i helped...

It made me feel better to get out of the house and enjoy the scenery of a nice park. Maybe take a book or listen to music. Take it easy, if you smoke frequently you might get out of breath quickly. Bring some water and a snack or some candy. Also picking up an easy hobby to keep your hands busy, like sketching or origami?

693,"We can't all be winners. Maybe I'm just supposed to lose? As I'm nearing my 30's hope is making way for resignation. More and more milestones are being passed unsuccessfully and less milestones remain. I know we can't all be the winners, there must be losers too. You can say that the losers are merely the ones who didn't want success hard enough but, realistically, I think it's safe to say some losers are just unlucky. I have never been exceptional in a positive sense, though I have failed spectacularly. I don't dream of greatness anymore, I dream of becoming mediocre and even that is slipping away these days. I have no job, lost my relationship, no degrees, no skills and a bad body. We all see resignation as a taboo, but how long does a person have to fail before it becomes evident that person will fail until he, she, they or whatever else will continue to fail, lose and forfeit until they are dead?

716,"I never asked to be alive, so why do I have to stay alive?. It wasn't my decision to come into this world. If no one wants me here than why do I have to work this hard to be here?","Youa re comdemned to a life of freedom. Is an old quote i tihnk its from satre, but im not sure. And later there has been others who disagree. You are forced to become alive and aware that much is for sure. Unlike most animals you are a creature born with the abillity gather information and draw conclusion not jsut based on your senses, and that oftens leads to the question. Why am i alive? Not only that, you are forced into not just a world, but a particular part of the word, which then in turn will teach you values and conformaty, and for some people this works out well. If you can find it in yourself to look at the context you have born into and be satisfied with it, enjoy it and love it, if you can find shelter, food, sleep, joy, love and challenge in you enviroment. But for some of us, we don't fin those things, we suddenly find ourself in a enviroment that conflicts with our nature, the context of our existence is not operationable with the essence of our nature. You first statement i cannot, say is wrong, you didn't decide to exist, but netiher did you chose not to. And existing in of itself is not evil or good. But if the context of your life is making your life or nature feel haunted and painful. Then a there are options available. The first thing, no matter how you want to change your context for the better, rquires that you step back and see the context. Where are you from, what values have been impsoed on you, which makes sense to you which doesn't, how has these values been imposed, who has impsoed them. For these purposes your reasoning is a great tool. It easy to finda figure head or a single person to blame, but you really have to map it out, and see udnerstand ana analyse your einvirotment and the people in it, and then find the conflicts with your nature, the pain and sadness. Then you have to figure out a plan. And this is a tremendous task, not just do you have to think thoguhts you ahve not been taught to think, you have to be critical of a system that raised you and shaped you. You have to go against the nature of what normal is and accept yourself. And then you ahve to find out how you want to change the context of your life. alkohol amkes me miserable, and everyone i know drinks Find people you can exist with with out alcohol My father is violent Create an existence were you are independant from him School is terrible translate My class mates bully me daily Find another school thes are simple i know, and jsut examples. Now i know you asked why do i have to do all this hard work and i threw some of the most difficult work and ideas at you. But the things is all what ive jsut said is the reasonalbe arguemtn for you nature, essence and existence and a way to improve it. when you ask why, reason is not a tool that can answer. its like trying to build a ship using lead, sure maybe it can be done, but its deffinately not the best way. Refelection, abstract thought, contemplation, emotion, empathy. those are the tools to arrive at an answer. If reason was used, human life wouldn't really have value. If you were the head of state and only used reason, you would quickly realize, human lives are not what drives you foward, what makes progress and creates a super power. And lives could turn into numbers. Sure educated people anda strong work force is good reasonable arguments to have a population, but only if they are educated or strong. Using reason to determine worth of life can lead to terrible ideas or no answers. You have to work hard right now, because you are worth it depsise allt he pain you are in you are worth it, and you deserve to be your best you. And if you don't liek working 8 hours a day then sleep 8 hours and then have 8 hours for yourself. Then there are options, but because you born into this context you ahve to work hard to get to those oprions. It is hard to change your enviroment. You have to stay alive becuase, you know a humans life has worth and you are one. When you see another in pain you wish he wouldn't ahve to be, when i see your words and want to help you but am incapable i still try. You have worth because of all the thigns you have not done yet, and all the people who have not enjoyed you future self.

718,Does anyone else feel like they get attached to random people?. I'm just curious because for me I just seem to develop a fondness towards anyone who shows me the slightest kindness. I hardly know them if I know them at all and I'm afraid to actually know them since they'll hate me or I'll drag them down.,"Yep. In conversations with my therapist, we have discussed me having some kind of attachment disorder around this. I am constantly seeking and craving connection with others. I can be at an airport and be thinking about connecting with other people. We traced it to childhood stuff (no surprise there) of abandonment and alienation, unmet emotional needs. Then when and if I do connect, my expectations are pretty high since I am willing to do whatever to reach out to the other person and increase the connection. When that is not reciprocated to the expectations that I have (because they are not trying to fill the massive hole that I am), I feel rejected and then shut down. I internalize this sense as a rejection of me as a person (they don't like me, I'm not worth liking, they got to know and discovered i'm no good). Rinse. Repeat. That's my pattern at least. Knowing the pattern helps, but it doesn't mean I can always identify it and stop it.

Embrace who you are with all the bright and dark sides and don't force yourself to hide the dark sides; that's what we're taught to do but it's the root for unhappiness.,0,0,0,1,0.4650735557079315,0.32469019293785095,0.45158693194389343,0.3817614018917084,0.48978158831596375,0.35286566615104675,0.4392147958278656,0.5588783025741577,0.3529714047908783,0.47471582889556885,0.520118772983551,0.41517508029937744,0.4377647042274475,0.6617408990859985,0.3468928039073944,0.23398546874523163,0.44839367270469666,0.5350894927978516,0.6436144113540649,0.6164319515228271,0,0.5005848407745361,0.2377784699201584,0.39484938979148865,0.407030314207077,0.4796907901763916,0.32190072536468506,0.2676556408405304,0.6826032996177673,0.20190922915935516,0.47934144735336304,0.4845375716686249,0.4917249083518982,0.4223138391971588,0.7369080781936646,0.25752630829811096,0.21138563752174377,0.5346958041191101,0.5164109468460083,0.6914867162704468,0.7574446201324463
759,The loneliness literally hurts. I guess I just long for companionship so much that I feel like I'm in pain I'm so lonely. And my stupid brain won't allow me to go out and meet people because I'm so depressed. Who would want someone like this.... I can't take it.,"This is why communities like this are amazing. We're all at our lowest, and sometimes our worst. We can't judge in the end, at least, I can say so for myself. I feel your pain. Always wanting to be alone with my pain but having it magnified for it. It cuts in a way no knife can reach. I know anytime you post here everyone jumps in with this, but though I suck at human contact my inbox is open if you just want to chat. I'm painfully lonely at times too, and bare minimum we can relate to that.",1,0,2,1,0.5060733556747437,0.19432005286216736,0.590557336807251,0.31891414523124695,0.5626657605171204,0.32051461935043335,0.4638817012310028,0.5670195817947388,0.1638231873512268,0.48486417531967163,0.5193672776222229,0.47739627957344055,0.556126594543457,0.5745546221733093,0.4066464602947235,0.26375824213027954,0.5121073722839355,0.4345613121986389,0.6115033626556396,0.8465871214866638,0,0.42239513993263245,0.18198318779468536,0.5712932348251343,0.3983011543750763,0.4847986400127411,0.2577882707118988,0.32219046354293823,0.6606358885765076,0.28804445266723633,0.392765611410141,0.48808977007865906,0.27380242943763733,0.6961209774017334,0.5885845422744751,0.31219443678855896,0.20748014748096466,0.5178184509277344,0.6328710913658142,0.7080292105674744,0.644532322883606

761,"I have nothing to look forward to. I never have anything to look forward to the next day or even a few days/weeks in advance. I just exist every day and live as in i keep my vital processes going by eating and breathing. I dont have any friends or social events to go to so as soon as I'm done with classes i just go back to my room and fuck around on my computer until i have to go to bed. It's hard for me to sleep and it has been for years and i finally figured out that one of the reasons for this is that i know i have nothing to look forward to when I wake up the next day. It wont be a happy or good or eventful day, it will just be a day. Maybe once every year or two I will have one thing to look forward to the next day and I can sleep much better the night before because I'm excited.

Most teachers would be happy to have you reach out, plus by being in communication with them, they'll be there to help keep your motivation up. Work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades, maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work. I hate to say this, but school academics come over sports. If time mangement is becoming hard, maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position. Freshmen year is easiest for most, so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year. I'm sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this, but the first step is admitting you want help which you've done so good job!

795,"A very dear friend died and i dont feel very different. Ever since the last year i was trying to convince myself that im not depressed and not diferent in any way from others around me but yesterday a very close friend died in a crash accident and my state of mind has not changed. Dont get me wrong, last night i cried whenever i thought of her but my mind and anxiety have not gotten worse nor better. 2 years ago, my school friend died in a suicide jump from a bridge and i know how i felt on that day and it's diferent now because then i felt diferent after hearing the news. Now i just felt like i needed to cry a bit, no sudden sorrow or anxiety attack, and that's what scares me that i trully am depressed.

800,"My boyfriend of 3 years and I just broke up and I feel so lost. My boyfriend and I have just broken up for the second time in our 3 year relationship. He's my best friend and we have been through hell together. I am a mess. I don't know what to do. I am in school right now and I feel no motivation. I can't sleep, I can't eat, and I can't breathe. I went to a counselor today but it didn't help much. I feel so lost, and I dont know what to do. I'm so lonely, my friends haven't been much help. We have mutual friends and I feel like I am losing them. I am so lost. I already have health problems and this is just killing me.","My boyfriend and i officially broke up yesterday. The pain you are feeling is not foolish nor is it you being weak. When we tend to get into relationships we often more time than not replace friendships with our partners. And as time progresses the person is not just simply a partner but a friend whom is apart of the very foundation our life is build upon. I am not sure why you two broke up. And i know it hurts extremely bad, and life has lost much of its meaning. I will it try to come up with some lighthearted crap that tells you everything is going to disappear quickly. This will be tough, this will hurt, and at times it will feel like nothing at all is worth living for. But i must tell you this feeling is temporary..... it will not last forever. How long it will last i cannot say, when it will end i cannot say either. But take it one day at a time. Do things that are only necessary for your existence. And those that are extra if you are not up to it do it. Within the relationship i am sure there were flaws on both parts, beat yourself up about them.

813,Depression. I struggled with depression for quite some time now. I did so well at finding the light in life and doing things not even imagineable...but lately that light has been dulling out again and I am worried that I will hit that rock bottom again.,"Stay positive friend! Keep your momentum going! I've had two mantras that I've carried with me since I first muddled through depression as a child. The first is Momentum. I start my day by making my bed, and it gives me a little feeling of accomplishment, and I make it to the next thing, and I try to carry this energy throughout the day, and into the next day. The second is Resolve, and it comes out on the days where I just completely dropped my momentum. These days are much harder, and I have to remember that its worth continuing on, that there's always a little beauty in every moment, even if it's sad beauty, and that I am able to help in the world. Today was a Resolve day for me, but I'm really hoping to get back into a Momentum day tomorrow! Keep a hold of the reasons you found the light, and the way that light made you feel.",0,0,2,1,0.5212365984916687,0.21341216564178467,0.4591313302516937,0.18359287083148956,0.6301934123039246,0.4231642484664917,0.5958335995674133,0.4073214530944824,0.05715714767575264,0.5329816937446594,0.5139061808586121,0.4820192754268646,0.567253053188324,0.4240882396697998,0.46488577127456665,0.36246150732040405,0.4353117048740387,0.5593714714050293,0.6853998899459839,0.8100944757461548,0,0.48430708050727844,0.25650864839553833,0.5302366614341736,0.2901061177253723,0.4954279959201813,0.27770358324050903,0.409114807844162,0.5462104678153992,0.33015453815460205,0.41307681798934937,0.5204383730888367,0.38665059208869934,0.6445484757423401,0.532477080821991,0.3736772835254669,0.16329096257686615,0.4659629166126251,0.6033927202224731,0.7112134099006653,0.5892685055732727

819,"Sometimes I wonder if I really even have depression. I was diagnosed 2 or 3 years ago by my family doctor, who prescribed SSRIs \(which I never took\). My moods range from suicidal and self harming to just feeling out of sorts and not at peace with myself. Sometimes I go months without feeling like that, sometimes it seems to come about every few weeks and lasts for weeks at a time. I don't know, I sometimes compare myself to my boyfriend who has a team of psychologists and psychiatrists working to diagnose him, whereas I just went to my family doctor, filled in a questionnaire, and boom got labelled with depression. I wonder if I'm faking it or blowing my feelings out of proportion, especially comparing it to more serious cases of mental illness. Does anyone else ever feel this way? How do you deal with it?","Just because you don't or can't have access to that level of mental health care does not mean your own mental illness is any less valid. I have always had a team, a prescribing doctor, therapist, and GP. Sometimes specifically a team that works together, sometimes just doctor's that kind of share notes but don't ever meet up. I am very lucky. Very few people get this level of treatment. Any number of genuine suicidal thoughts is too many. Everyone gets depressed, but when you stay there long enough to consider life actually painful to live you have depression. It can be really hard not to play mental illness Olympics. But someone else struggling more does not take away from your own struggle. Your feelings, your illness, are real. They're valid. They have NOTHING to do with anyone else's struggles. Just as theirs has nothing to do with you.

826,Im so fucking tired of being alone. Why is love so complicated,"Life is like a wave. There are ups and downs. One day, no matter how hard been, your life will get better again. But until then, see all the bad stuff that is going on in your life as because in reality, there is no such thing as or You define if it is. Try to find the postive part in your current situation. There is always a reason, why some things happen. The reason is, to teach you a lesson. For example: if you have no friends (like me), see it as negative. Try to find the lesson behind this experience. In this case, life wants to tell you, that loneliness is not what you, in your deepest self, want. You need persons such as friends around you. Take a desicion now, that you want to be lonely anymore, and life will listen to you and bring you friends again, and if it work, try to know, why it (i know the answer, but a bit complicated (msg me if you want to know)) and what the lesson in this experience is. Also: Life is like a mirror. If you feel lonely inside, the outside world will deliver you that loneliness. pretty simple. So if you want to be lonely anymore, try not to feel lonely (i know fking hard, but you can reach that with more knowledge about the truth (msg me if you want to know more). If you feel lonely inside, that means, that the outside world will automaticlly deliver you NOT-loneliness, which means new persons will enter your life.  Oh also: Life is a paradox. right with love being complicated, but at the same time, the easiest thing you could possibly imagine.

I guess I always kinda knew the bits and pieces of problems I have, but I pieced them all together today. My depression started because I was isolated during a school semester (plus hammered with various stress, family and medical). And so.. my self esteem dropped. When I was able to get home, I still felt isolated because being away at school for so long... it felt like I didn't have the same interests as my friends at home anymore. My self esteem continued to drop. I separated from my toxic family, and felt a lot of loss. So... about now, my self esteem is rock bottom. Now it's hard to find connections with people, because I fall into cycles of feeling so negatively about myself. Like a hole I don't have the strength to pull myself out of. I just wish I had someone who could throw me a line, and work with me for a little while until I can get back on my feet! But.. I'm alone. What can I do KNOWING this, but being unable to act on it?

Update: I'm feeling slightly better thanks to you guys, but it's slowly coming back again and I kept on doing on what you guys are telling me to do and I'm officially lost in the mind again help if you can.","Do your parents tell you that you're a failure? My mom and dad both did that to me for a while. I'm 16. I used to be depressed over my bad grades and I had this constant anxious feeling that my life was over because of these bad grades and I would amount to nothing. Then all of a sudden one day, I noticed that bad grades in high school aren't the end of the world. It might have been because I moved out of my Dad's place and I didn't have to hear him call me a failure anymore. Either way, I became happy again. Then I met her. A nice girl who was my age. She had a pretty face, we had a ton of classes together, and she thought I was really funny. I was able to open up to her. I think (I know) I fell in love with her. She had a boyfriend though. He's a shitty person. He's high all the time and he always flirts around with other girls. I really thought she would break it off with him and find her way to my arms and I'd be the happiest guy in the world. That didn't happen. I became desperate. I began to have a drinking problem because of it. One night while very drunk I texted her a bunch of things about my depression. I don't think she cares about me anymore. Now I find myself drunk and alone for the umpteenth time wondering how I let myself get depressed again.  Basically what I wanna say to you is: your life's not over, it's just beginning. Whatever it is that makes you feel like a failure is probably a problem that is possible to overcome. Just focus on you and don't let other people get in your way and bring you down like I did. Don't let anyone else determine your happiness. Control your life. You can do it.",1,0,2,1,0.47707289457321167,0.33895352482795715,0.5273008346557617,0.12169539928436279,0.22947819530963898,0.35134008526802063,0.5449217557907104,0.6053878664970398,0.39601343870162964,0.518973708152771,0.545486569404602,0.4733230173587799,0.5344200730323792,0.6216771006584167,0.38359370827674866,0.15605956315994263,0.3188585638999939,0.5195038914680481,0.67851722240448,0.37268415093421936,0,0.41513970494270325,0.29560586810112,0.44076254963874817,0.44051632285118103,0.48964548110961914,0.2422896772623062,0.37465235590934753,0.6262680292129517,0.37707486748695374,0.3539857268333435,0.603816568851471,0.4309152364730835,0.614690899848938,0.7275429368019104,0.2910020351409912,0.21089854836463928,0.531789243221283,0.6794700622558594,0.884335994720459,0.6918161511421204

853,What can I do to help my wife with her depression?. She's been in a funk for a while now and there's no end in sight. I thought I would just let her ride it out but I can't stand to see her like this. Any help would be great.,"That's really hard! I would encourage you in whatever efforts you take, to focus on compassionate presence, rather than simply solving a problem. Your present company, your listening ear, your genuine love for her is likely to be more helpful than if she starts to feel like she's just a problem that you're trying to solve. Beyond that, sometimes we need a little push to get counseling, or just eat a bit better, or get outside. Those things don't usually solve the problem in isolation, but they can help build her positive momentum. You can't be her savior, but you can help build a ramp towards something.",1,0,0,1,0.4730413854122162,0.30349302291870117,0.6275608539581299,0.2647787928581238,0.42196255922317505,0.2977222800254822,0.410114586353302,0.6461077928543091,0.43819549679756165,0.5270212292671204,0.45111778378486633,0.41191303730010986,0.551294207572937,0.5629233717918396,0.4109172523021698,0.28161850571632385,0.38512927293777466,0.4863889515399933,0.6421103477478027,0.5586476922035217,0,0.42723312973976135,0.2292642742395401,0.5413272380828857,0.3861662447452545,0.4811781644821167,0.24082092940807343,0.3127194046974182,0.6021008491516113,0.2867555022239685,0.42951780557632446,0.5182147026062012,0.32374995946884155,0.6602826714515686,0.6315826177597046,0.31745603680610657,0.12241324782371521,0.5105534195899963,0.6085063815116882,0.7268925905227661,0.5160087943077087

880,"I actually did something today!. I fucking finally cleaned my room and did some laundry! I know this is barely anything and kind of pathetic, but it feels really good and I wanted to share with someone who might understand. I hope tomorrow is like this, but I'm not exactly hopeful","Good work. Don't just hope for a good tomorrow, make it happen. Life doesn't happen to you, you happen to it. I know sometimes energy and motivation level feels out of your control, but sometimes when you're feeling low that's actually the most important time to get up and move. Today you just experienced how getting things done is what made you feel good. Too many people want to feel good first, and then act. Most times it works in the opposite way, act first and feel good after. You don't have to be at the mercy of waiting for these random days when you suddenly get something done. Make it happen. Life is like a game of momentum and inertia. Even doing something small is better than nothing. I like the mentality of trying not to have any Zero days. Don't let a day go by where you did absolutely nothing productive. It only takes something small to qualify as more than zero. And then it becomes fun trying to keep going and not letting any days slip by. Setting small goals is a good way to get moving. Large goals can seem overwhelming. Trick yourself by saying you're just going to start with 5 minutes, and often times you'll end up doing a lot more.",1,0,0,1,0.6779130697250366,0.501194953918457,0.46801310777664185,0.1708282232284546,0.40852153301239014,0.44075149297714233,0.5320873260498047,0.5779938697814941,0.487400084733963,0.5347922444343567,0.5023308396339417,0.4232470393180847,0.49953755736351013,0.4352381229400635,0.44876980781555176,0.4296858012676239,0.3574574291706085,0.43866607546806335,0.6182056665420532,0.3831713795661926,0,0.5246268510818481,0.1743399053812027,0.45171087980270386,0.3685191571712494,0.49686625599861145,0.25127846002578735,0.41912248730659485,0.5356053113937378,0.3067418038845062,0.4579489529132843,0.5672834515571594,0.32479721307754517,0.5992027521133423,0.5564837455749512,0.3468666672706604,0.14742960035800934,0.5265566110610962,0.5893996357917786,0.7058718800544739,0.5549195408821106
881,When things keep getting worse...after you've tried everything.... Doom. Absolute doom. I'm fucked.,"Yes right. So my rational mind would tell me right now dealing with something but as experience has showed me I will be better once through it. So the practical thing for me to do would be to relax and be aware of my tendencies to fall victim to my emotions which in turn produce thoughts that are self destructive and wasting my time. See to be emotional is irrationality and far from practical. Take some time out and just breathe and let the shit go...you got this. you are right now...literally and I want to fall into those emotions and spread the way I feel everywhere. I want those who love me to know and those who hate me to know more but in the f u kinda way. But we because we have been here before and got through it-and we were happy again-and bam we are here now. But we will be happy again. You know what would make me happy right buffalo wings lol...like for real. That is the break through-realizing that it fucking sucks sometimes. So what, supposed too...because that is what makes buffalo wings sooo much better hahahaha. I hope you feel better all I wish for you!!!",1,0,0,1,0.5196780562400818,0.14648307859897614,0.6812716126441956,0.3401184380054474,0.6105167865753174,0.35174280405044556,0.5556104183197021,0.49589186906814575,0.04758267104625702,0.5093183517456055,0.5244707465171814,0.48760277032852173,0.5745059251785278,0.4452492892742157,0.4932001531124115,0.3127696216106415,0.4707077443599701,0.4789721667766571,0.6203051805496216,0.9292402863502502,0,0.41648274660110474,0.2367166131734848,0.5079849362373352,0.34837770462036133,0.4554040729999542,0.2157875895500183,0.37244367599487305,0.6114508509635925,0.30481669306755066,0.3639413118362427,0.47867482900619507,0.2697667181491852,0.6540347933769226,0.5084668397903442,0.3024403154850006,0.0836683064699173,0.46735185384750366,0.6494258642196655,0.6835027933120728,0.4601766765117645

897,My depression is killing the vibe among my friends. Which is probably why I'm pushing people away...,"Let others suffer with you. The biggest struggle with depression is the isolation box it confines us in. It fools us into believing there is no one that will understand. Tells us not to burden others with our problems. Demands we keep our pain in the shadows. But this is the nasty cycle that keeps us locked in to our loneliness. We feel lonely, hate that we feel lonely, feel stupid for looking weak, and decide to keep it hidden. We find worth in our connection to others. Not because they decide if we are worthy or not, but simply because our ability to contribute what is in us is only useful in light of others. I'm not sure of your circumstances, but I can tell you that I have been in your shoes. I have felt completely cut off from the world. I have laid in bed night after night, wondering why I should even be here. I have been so lost and hard on myself that I couldn't even look at my face in the mirror. I have broken down in just about every room of the places I lived and expected it to never change. But it did. Not all at once. It took time. But when I began to open up to others and let them struggle with me and offer help. And by also helping others myself. It doesn't need to be family or current friends.

912,"Life without Joy. I've been dealing with depression for (at least) three years now, with varying levels of severity. There have been some real lows, but I know that's to be expected. What concerns me more than the presence of these lows, however, is the complete absence of highs. In other words, I feel no joy whatsoever. I really don't remember the last time I did. Despite seeing a counselor regularly, working out 2-3 times each week, meditating daily, and trying out multiple medications, I've seen no improvement in that regard. It takes a lot for me to do all of those things, so it's obviously pretty discouraging that I'm not seeing any results. Anyone else have this issue?","I feel only bad things, too. I can laugh and joke with my buddies, but it just feels hollow and empty on the inside. I even come to think, that I often times smile and laugh, cause I know a normal person would do this and I did it once, so to don't look like a freak, I do it at the right times. But I'm never excited these days. I can't even remember the last time I was. Even when I decided to lose my virginity to a prostitute when I was around 30, I had some concerns but I wasn't excited. Birthdays and partys, I knew I couldn't wait for some when I was in my early twenties. Nowadays, I actually have to push myself to go out and meet friends, even though I absolutly KNOW it will be a nice evening. So, I understand what is up with you.

915,"I'm curious about how anti-depressants have affected you. I've been dealing with depression since I was 12 (I'm nearly 19 now) and in the past, my doctor recommended anti-depressants. I was hesitant because I've had friends say it essentially makes you feel like an emotionless robot, so I ended up declining that option entirely. I feel like my depression has only gotten worse and worse and am now looking to meds as a last resort. To anyone currently/previously on anti-depressants, could you tell me how it's affected you both mentally and physically? Thank you all &lt;3","Really depends on the particular medication. Everyone responds differently as well. I have mostly had bad experiences with antidepressants, but I am not a good example. I know people who really improved while being on them.

932,"is having an episode a reason to take a few days off?. Its never been as bad as right now, i detest myself. i honestly couldn't see me going to work like that tomorrow. so is that reason enough?",I think that avoiding work to sit at home in your misery is a bad thing. Getting out of the house is recommended even if it's something like going to work. Obviously do whatever you feel is best but I don't think skipping work is going to help you get any better. For example I could barely get out of bed this morning to go to work but even though I'm here hating it I would alternatively be at home sleeping until 2pm then lay in bed on my phone all day.,0,0,2,1,0.47441229224205017,0.2162075936794281,0.4756041467189789,0.32207462191581726,0.5199877619743347,0.3239942789077759,0.3893468677997589,0.5495495796203613,0.18283413350582123,0.4495636522769928,0.4832441210746765,0.4073503911495209,0.4554603695869446,0.4905986487865448,0.30989035964012146,0.24566851556301117,0.43997570872306824,0.4583588242530823,0.5812576413154602,0.5792078971862793,0,0.39042267203330994,0.1378241628408432,0.6384354829788208,0.41121533513069153,0.5332221984863281,0.22810733318328857,0.38214439153671265,0.6582925319671631,0.15416821837425232,0.364600270986557,0.48140379786491394,0.25748777389526367,0.7237187623977661,0.49317577481269836,0.3196873068809509,0.11106131970882416,0.5451509356498718,0.6245629787445068,0.6224724650382996,0.5855361223220825

Being outdoors just makes me feel lonely as hell and without companionship.

945,Have any of you ever ran away from home?. What was your experience like and how did running away affect your depression/behavior?,"I ran away two times as a teenager. One time I was gone for a couple of months. I only went back when I became physically ill and couldn't afford meds. I begged my parents to let me come home and buy my prescriptions. I had a terrible UTI and bladder infection. Going back home was terrible and good at the same time. I was sad to be home, my parents were angry with me and told me all the terrible things they believed about me while I was gone. Things they heard from other people and things I think they imagined. About 80% were completely untrue. I was a disappointment and a sinner. I was sad to be away from my boyfriend and glad to be away from him at the same time. He was considerably older than I and of course I had envisioned our life together as different. The second time I ran away I had a better plan partly. I took my clothes and anything else I could throw in my friends car and went to her house where she lived with her grandparents. The next morning I woke up to my Step Mom standing at my feet telling me to get up and come with her and Dad. I grew up very depressed, my Mother passed away when I was 2 1/2 years old, then my older sister passed away few years later. Every day I was sad. I didn't understand what happened, I didn't understand how something so terrible could happen and life changed drastically and in a flash. No one talked to me about any of it and I was broken. Walking to school in the morning, thru classes all day, walking home in the afternoon, having dinner, staring into the void during homework time, staring at the ceiling at night trying to go to sleep, I had a huge pain in my chest and I was alone.",0,0,2,1,0.41154465079307556,0.12927904725074768,0.5740001201629639,0.33784791827201843,0.6039152145385742,0.28731775283813477,0.35952523350715637,0.5861815810203552,0.18399323523044586,0.5221291780471802,0.46201232075691223,0.4830067753791809,0.5077834129333496,0.6224119067192078,0.35564860701560974,0.2175341695547104,0.5476226210594177,0.5846902132034302,0.7178505063056946,0.7694893479347229,0,0.20909979939460754,0.16842560470104218,0.4441571533679962,0.32098188996315,0.4838743507862091,0.39305877685546875,0.5163467526435852,0.3755488097667694,-0.000491982907988131,0.32933735847473145,0.47400426864624023,0.017111826688051224,0.6393337845802307,0.5115753412246704,0.3698555529117584,-0.22056588530540466,0.48744097352027893,0.8770750164985657,0.7654832005500793,0.6985456943511963

If you have the mental stregnth to seek help, get on medication, pursue interests you like and meet people through them and accept your reality, than maybe just maybe you can get better. Life is, in my opinion, just a series of accomplishments, experiences, relationships and habits... you need to have a groove and stick with it. Firstly, just be happy with yourself.

992,"For the past 6 months, I have had this persistent head pressure (not a migraine or headache). It's like my brain is expanding but has no room. It's incredibly distracting.. I've tried taking everything from excedrin to ibuprofen and neither do anything. I also find it incredibly difficult to concentrate and remember anymore, constantly needed things repeated over and over slowly. Aside from the insomnia, I feel like the head pressure, concentration and memory issues are the most crippling part of depression for me, more so than the feeling of anhedonia and emptiness. Has anyone else experienced this? Has anything worked for you? Does it even get better? I feel like there's no end in sight.","Do you have anger issues as well? I've been feeling like this too with head pressure.

1003,"I'm going to kill myself. Not today, but someday.... I feel like I'm headed in that direction","Just because you feel like you're headed in that direction, doesn't mean you actually are...and if you are, you can always turn the car around. You're the only one who controls the ride and where it goes. I've had many days (and I still have those days) where I've lost hope in life. Feel like there is no point to go on because no matter how much I try to get things on track, I fail. That no one cares about me, and if I were gone the whole world would have one less body to deal with. But, then I realize that these things are not permanent or untrue, and If i am not happy, I can change it...but, you can not change suicide. Try to take a step back and think about what brings you joy in your life currently, and think of the things you've enjoyed while growing up, and surround yourself with them. Try something new that you've always wished you'd try. These are all steps to a better life, one that's happier...and is definitely possible to achieve. It takes some time and work, but in the end it is worth it. Don't give up, the best things in life are always the ones that make you work the hardest for. Feeling like this, is not permanent, it's only temporary. You have many people who care for you, who I am quite certain will notice if you're gone, and would be devastated... not to mention the hundreds of other people you're robbing from the chance of getting to meet someone as amazing as you, too!

You life is once in a lifetime. You're lucky to be alive and to be human. For most people, things can usually get a lot worse.

Depression is a common part of my life but even when I'm not going through a cycle I still suffer from this blank mind where I simply can't organize a thought or put anything into words. I've come to a realization that it may be a form of anxiety. For me it can feel like an internal panic attack. I wish I could offer you some words of wisdom but I'm just know starting my battle to overcome it.,1,0,2,1,0.5090550184249878,0.18823696672916412,0.5500186681747437,0.35489150881767273,0.5726534724235535,0.28571265935897827,0.4716757833957672,0.6237771511077881,0.20411844551563263,0.5578104853630066,0.48542138934135437,0.37829554080963135,0.5757532119750977,0.6242109537124634,0.3880658447742462,0.17996172606945038,0.48615798354148865,0.5445657968521118,0.6715806126594543,0.6909507513046265,0,0.5234205722808838,0.29313600063323975,0.5302592515945435,0.18908248841762543,0.4187597930431366,0.27488261461257935,0.4822220504283905,0.5717294216156006,0.3528003692626953,0.5243112444877625,0.5620388388633728,0.46743226051330566,0.47515517473220825,0.5897694230079651,0.46402183175086975,0.3277440369129181,0.3199012875556946,0.5841015577316284,0.7029471397399902,0.6284458041191101

But I know how it can feel like nothing will ever change. So I propose that in order for you to prove things can't get better, give your life the absolute best shot you can give instead of giving up on it now. This way, you can *prove* to yourself and others that you're beyond saving, and the bridge will become a more reasonable option.

I answered: I guess plenty of people know that something isn't ok with you, but most people just care about their own shit or just don't know what to say. If you wanna talk... I'm here. She ended the dialouge with Thank you.... And she never wrote me again since then. I felt bad somehow. On the one hand, I just wanted to help, but she refused it somehow or I scared her too much. On the other hand... maybe I just made it worse for her, and that's of course not what I wanted. The human mind is a thing, no one can explain. It's infinite.",0,0,2,1,0.5247575044631958,0.2663898169994354,0.47379395365715027,0.3559935688972473,0.427261084318161,0.18260334432125092,0.3247189521789551,0.5916944146156311,0.3219192326068878,0.3616963028907776,0.5404456853866577,0.31784722208976746,0.5188480019569397,0.5689857602119446,0.39898040890693665,0.22492732107639313,0.5154982209205627,0.34800946712493896,0.48745784163475037,0.5116390585899353,0,0.37507137656211853,0.16057109832763672,0.5387575030326843,0.4101499617099762,0.5726747512817383,0.2727469503879547,0.370436429977417,0.6164165139198303,0.22217057645320892,0.40787214040756226,0.5715921521186829,0.24767820537090302,0.6389564275741577,0.6251095533370972,0.24179284274578094,0.14707712829113007,0.6324341893196106,0.6390954256057739,0.7107206583023071,0.6464552879333496

But, even subconscious you is empathetic and cares about others, which is a beautiful fuckin' thing to be. It's why you have the capacity to feel so bad, and it's also why you can (if you want to) be an amazing resource for people. Being able to feel things as deeply as you or I can is something to be cherished and protected and put to good use. The world could use more empathy, you know? It's okay to hate yourself too, btw.

1097,"Why does self harm feel good?. too much of a pussy to use a real knife but every time I feel suicidal, I use my nails the scratch deep into my skin. It stings, but also feels good. I know why.","quite a few things ive noticed for myself. ill over simplify my thought process to get the point across. Ill list them quickly. I thought that if I could go through physical pain, then I can go through mental pain. A physical scar is easier to understand that an emotional one. Having to tend to my wounds to stop the bleeding and cover them up distracted me from what I really wanted to tend to and cover up. There was a couple times where I self harmed because my thoughts were too overwhelming while I was trying to fall asleep. Afterwards, I would spend some time in the bathroom alone, taking care of my bleeding and by the time it was all finished, I forgot what I was thinking about. Self harm was an effort to try and beat life at its own game. If life was beating me up, maybe if I did a better job at that than life then maybe the punches life throws at me seem so bad. since moved on from this.

ADHD and depression are generally easier to manage long term than bipolar disorder, so that's a plus.",0,0,0,1,0.39149191975593567,0.17974154651165009,0.5752878189086914,0.2805488109588623,0.5470684766769409,0.2764665186405182,0.39956507086753845,0.6143414378166199,0.22107350826263428,0.5507345795631409,0.482186496257782,0.37647342681884766,0.512130081653595,0.6376661658287048,0.3195476830005646,0.20216897130012512,0.4629637897014618,0.5819988250732422,0.7302255034446716,0.753507673740387,0,0.46388712525367737,0.2636096477508545,0.44017380475997925,0.17774172127246857,0.4719654619693756,0.41556447744369507,0.290060430765152,0.6010622978210449,0.2894163429737091,0.48148131370544434,0.48438626527786255,0.4287504255771637,0.46842527389526367,0.5610030293464661,0.2720346450805664,0.36057353019714355,0.3782668709754944,0.5837745070457458,0.6519588828086853,0.6641975045204163

1139,Is anyone else incredibly funny irl but miserable af when they get home?. What kind of jokes do you do? Who knows what you really feel inside? Why do we rely on other people's happiness?,"It's fucking weird. I often have to bring every ounce of willpower up to bring myself to go to a party with frends, even though I know it will be good. But once I'm there, I'm often the Life of the Party, or so I think. I had people coming up to me, greeting me by my name and telling me how much fun they had last time we had met each other. Which was a year ago. For the first and last time since. I barely remembered their faces and not a single name. So I guess I left an impression. I really like to banter, to do play on words and take words from their mouth and turn them around in a fun way. I joke and tell stories with expressive facial expressions and big gestures. I'm sarcastic, sometimes even cynical. And I joke a lot about myself, mostly in a non-flattering way. I think people like me in general, I seldomly had someone outright refuse to interact with me. But on the other hand, as soon as I come home, I feel a crushing void and I feel alone and that everything is pointless. Those feelings remain in my day-to-day life. And it starts to interfere with my work, for example. I am not one to contain my feelings in an enviroment where I spend most of my days and life in. My boss already told me once, in a pretty long phase of being really depressed, that even my collegues said that something must be seriously wrong and the have no fun working around and with me if I'm in such mood. I can be fun at work, too. I made my co-workers laugh on a lot f different occasions. But that happens in good phases. But there are very bad phases where I, at best, don't say a single word all day unless absolutly necessary and at worst, I am filled with rage the whole day and can't contain it. Last week I was as close to quitting my job as I was never before. Maybe it would be best for all.  Whatever, long story short: I think I can be really funny, too.

1148,I wish I had artistic talent. Art has been my obsession all of my life but i'm so bad at it because i'm an idiot. a cognitively deficient fuck up is what i am,"Nah man, What you're saying is actually quite common of someone who is good at art. Most people with a high degree or artistic talent are really good at *recognizing* good art, but get frustrated because their own art doesn't live up to the crazy high standard they've set for themselves. Malcom Gladwell suggests that it takes 10,000 hours to gain mastery in something. Art is a skill just like anything else. I think a lot of people get fooled into this You either have it or you don't mentality when it comes to creative arts. It's just not the case. I think it's more important that you actually have an obsession and something that you want to be good at! Most people don't have that. Just keep practicing and never give up.

1166,Anyone depressed cause of loneliness?. I just want someone to love.,"That someone will come into your life when you least expect it.

I know the feeling, though can't be sure that's what you're worried about. Maybe it's about meeting people? People can be stupid, demanding and stuff. Sometimes, even friends can feel like a burden to some people. Doesn't mean they hate their friends, it just drains them to constantly have to cater to their friends to keep them. Maybe being in bed is just your favorite activity. You're addicted to it, just like people being addicted to video games. It makes you feel good to just lie there, as opposed to everything else. When you leave it, you suffer withdrawals. In that case, your best bet is to force yourself for three weeks. I know it's hard, but that's literally the only way to change it. You can get someone to help you do it, if you have friends nearby that can knock on your door and be mean to you for a few weeks. Can you tell me more about your experience lying in bed? What you feel, what your thoughts are about not lying in bed?",0,2,0,1,0.4852679669857025,0.40454742312431335,0.6235113739967346,0.14623749256134033,0.5656483173370361,0.4205179214477539,0.6012710332870483,0.5399791598320007,0.2122289538383484,0.48448097705841064,0.5241708159446716,0.54902184009552,0.4909374713897705,0.46931007504463196,0.4647282063961029,0.445594847202301,0.2963111996650696,0.5205745697021484,0.6585538387298584,0.6287692189216614,0,0.4598768949508667,0.17950941622257233,0.503369152545929,0.4240729510784149,0.5373204946517944,0.20649650692939758,0.3157446086406708,0.556511402130127,0.16914884746074677,0.3731255531311035,0.4489021897315979,0.21822641789913177,0.6030942797660828,0.6573139429092407,0.29827263951301575,0.08883312344551086,0.5558993220329285,0.6800589561462402,0.7380390763282776,0.7611746788024902
1185,Has medical marijuana worked for other peoples depression?. I'm just curious about peoples ideas on the matter.,"It helped at the beginning of my marijuana usage when I was smoking maybe 2-3 times a week but if it can spiral out of control pretty quickly to where it creates a vicious cycle of abuse. The marijuana also blew my anxiety through the roof. In my experience, the depression will come back once not high (and sometimes even worse than it was before getting high) which has the potential for psychological dependence. Within 9 months of beginning self medication I went from smoking like $10 worth 2-3 times a week to 2-3 times a day so beware. By the end of the 9 month period I was spending about $200 a week on weed. Would possibly recommend but i think the best idea for those with addictive/binging personalities because you could end up seriously abusing it during massive depressive episodes.",0,0,2,1,0.416652649641037,0.27583053708076477,0.47868600487709045,0.33290421962738037,0.47692981362342834,0.2588724195957184,0.3793151080608368,0.5957202911376953,0.40267956256866455,0.5034546852111816,0.5131165981292725,0.48961520195007324,0.5139611959457397,0.5271854400634766,0.2632046639919281,0.2587984800338745,0.39613834023475647,0.5972973704338074,0.66477370262146,0.545164167881012,0,0.39482128620147705,0.2245568484067917,0.5650352239608765,0.38237860798835754,0.5431218147277832,0.23672908544540405,0.36647623777389526,0.6242071390151978,0.20136846601963043,0.404116153717041,0.5102816820144653,0.3231152892112732,0.7050976157188416,0.5382422208786011,0.2896842658519745,0.22499150037765503,0.5568529963493347,0.5698062181472778,0.716758668422699,0.8156789541244507

1191,Your experience with cannabis and mental health?. Love to hear people personal stories on the topic.,"I've smoked pot about 7 times or so. First time freaked me out, made me a little paranoid. I kept trying it in small doses and never really made me feel nice, just kinda paranoid. The very last time I took it I was with 2 friends and I took like 1 big-ish hit and became paranoid, again. Unfortunately, I spent that night freaking out over my heart racing and thinking I was going to have a heart attack. This ended up developing into chronic heart anxiety. This was about 4 or so years ago and now I live with extremely, extremely bad anxiety. I thought it'd be nice using it as an escape for my depression back then but never made me feel nice, alcohol did weirdly.

Fucking hell, and they blatantly laughed for minutes on end while i was faking my own. And they would bring it up at least once every time they fucking saw me. oh we were just joking man cmon when I jokingly but not so jokingly said I was going to kill myself.

1208,I want to die. That's all I have to say,"Most of us on this have been/are there. I know i have. I tend to dwell on the past far too often and besides it's obvious drawbacks it does have one advantage. Remembering the time i did want to die and how I thought there was no other way out. But I decided to live and I haven't actually wanted to die since. Sure things suck, most of the time for longer than we'd like but there are alot of things that make life on this planet right now worth living. I personally am not religious. I think once your dead it's lights out and I very much enjoy consciousness. I only felt what it was like living without it once or twice and those were not pleasant experiences. I'm still technically Depressed, I have been most of my life and likely will be until it's over or I find what it is i need to do with myself to get there. What helped me go from uber frustrated to content is to continue to evolve. I cut off everyone i knew and reevaluated what I want in life... Apparently it's living in a van and not staying anywhere long enough to feel stagnant. I'm not at all a people person and i have a family full of happy go lucky dimwits who talk nonsense and gossip repeating the same routine like that i what life is. That's not what i want. To be happy you need to forget about everyone and their bullshit, and be who you are where you are. Experience what life is, don't waste it and don't throw it away before you've lived it fully. I'm stuck right now, been hibernating as my little brothers personal housekeeper because my anxiety drives me to near agoraphobia. But once i get out of here I'll take all the lessons I've learned on /r/vandwellers and start my life as i know it should be and hopefully that brings me piece of mind for once. That's what works for me, but if your not an antisocial INTP then you might not want to live in a van lol. But I'm sure there is some way you see life should be... There's an entire world out there, look at the room around you and remember that's less than a microbe in the grand scheme of things. Do what what want do what drives you, not what you think is expected of you. It's your life, you are the one setting the standards and accepting them. Fuck everyone else.",0,0,2,1,0.6306350231170654,0.3162141740322113,0.46164965629577637,0.20235055685043335,0.4966355264186859,0.30359309911727905,0.7428064942359924,0.49048885703086853,0.3910626769065857,0.6136481761932373,0.5865767002105713,0.5833108425140381,0.6227789521217346,0.42097756266593933,0.5863067507743835,0.34920915961265564,0.35588207840919495,0.5528032779693604,0.6258093118667603,0.5152707099914551,0,0.41225335001945496,0.20504643023014069,0.41198351979255676,0.37751954793930054,0.5208783149719238,0.3587665259838104,0.3654545545578003,0.5419312715530396,0.2371932715177536,0.35252171754837036,0.5356370210647583,0.16634438931941986,0.6449778079986572,0.5563603639602661,0.28642788529396057,-0.07943220436573029,0.5599337220191956,0.6922923922538757,0.6345822215080261,0.3938274085521698

I was having an emotional breakdown about something earlier and my boyfriend tried calming me down. He tried holding/hugging me but I told him to get away from me and said that he doesn't love me and that he's only with me until he finds someone else. He grabbed me and told me that I'm beautiful and that he loves me and that I'm his heart. I continued tried to push him off of me but he just kept holding me tighter. He led me to the bedroom and we laid on the bed and he held me until I fell asleep. When I got up he asked me if I was okay and I told him yes. He asked are you sure and I got annoyed and screamed yes at him. Why am I the way that I am?,"It's called genetics, I would suggest seeing a doctor, but but why the hell should you listen to me?

1221,Fuck. When you try to relate but you'd rather kill yourself.,"hi there, forgive me if I'm wrong with regards to what you are referring to. How I understand your statement is that you try to relate to others but rather do the latter. If this is the case, I want to let you know that even though sometimes you feel you are compelled to relate to other because of societal pressures, you really don't and it depends to what extent. It's important to be who you are and be with people where you can be who you are. But that doesn't mean your depressed you is who you are as a person. Your depression is only a part of who you are, not your defining being. Don't define yourself as 'a depressed person' but more so 'a person that has depression right now at this stage of my life.' Because depression goes away or can be managed very well where it doesn't intrude on your life in a daily or constant basis. You are much more than your depression. Try to take smell steps that you are comfortable with and learn some coping strategies in managing depressed feelings. Ideally it'll be great if you can see a therapist but I understand that has it's own restrains. The key thing is to never give up on yourself because when you believe, there will be a way out of this. I always tell others that healing isn't easy but it's worth it because you are worth it, whether you feel it right now or not.",1,0,0,1,0.5339392423629761,0.16264007985591888,0.5282050967216492,0.39418673515319824,0.6331888437271118,0.30967503786087036,0.46702075004577637,0.513534426689148,0.11754193902015686,0.5115029215812683,0.48948684334754944,0.43919306993484497,0.5931193828582764,0.6423911452293396,0.37137070298194885,0.20954091846942902,0.5677195191383362,0.4422059953212738,0.6211665272712708,0.6856321096420288,0,0.5593835115432739,0.32034215331077576,0.35260602831840515,0.33692774176597595,0.4183357059955597,0.24692986905574799,0.4441970884799957,0.5089569687843323,0.3063586354255676,0.42258137464523315,0.5170413851737976,0.30366551876068115,0.549620509147644,0.6153720021247864,0.3890209496021271,0.0949789434671402,0.43908369541168213,0.6828024387359619,0.7328768372535706,0.5461902022361755

1241,Anyone else feel emotionally numb for most of their lives?. The last time I was truly excited for anything was as a kid. But once I grew out of the Christmas excitement age never really been excited for anything since. It seems like other people get excited when friends or family get married or have kids. Even when my brother got married I feel anything about it. never had anyone really close to me die before but even when my grandparents and great grandparents died I feel sad or anything. I really close but I always thought I should have felt something for them. Same thing when someone gets hurt. I remember when my brother broke his arm when I was a teenager and everyone made a big deal of it and I feel a thing. I worried or scared or anything. I just feel like I have the same emotions as everyone else. Anyone else feel this way?,"I guess you just become a realist? An example, a family was diagnosed with diabetes and the doctors told her that if she waited for another hour before going to the doctor that she could have died. All the family was worried. But me? I just thought If she dies, well, it was her time. The things that happen to everyone else don't apply anymore to you.

1245,Are there any methods to coping with depression and suicidal thoughts that actually works?. Emotional support does nothing for me yet I see it everywhere. I think many of us need some real help,"Depression isn't something you can get rid of by wishing it away or telling someone you have it. A lot like an addiction you have to fight to get out of it. And it's hard to tell what path is right or wrong. Talking to people does help. But you need to find someone you can talk to. I couldn't talk to my mom for the life of me, my sister would tell my mom or tell me I was wrong, my dad just gave me a look and didn't know what to say besides he cares about me. Once my mom knew the extent of my depression she became better at helping me. She listened and didn't judge. She let me talk and told didn't lecture but reassured my decisions. She went out of her way to make me feel more confident. That's the person you need to find. Also try writing your feeling down whatever you feel on a peace of paper what ever is on your mind. Write it in chicken scratch don't worry about how ty write just write what you feel. Then throw the paper away. That used to help me, not as much as my mom did but I did help. Life isn't something we can live alone although a lot of us want to, I wish I could, find someone to confide in that supports you.",0,0,2,1,0.5694139003753662,0.42645779252052307,0.44569161534309387,0.11375769972801208,0.3266943097114563,0.39144980907440186,0.3846472501754761,0.5713805556297302,0.39487090706825256,0.5231119990348816,0.43955257534980774,0.45474380254745483,0.508861780166626,0.5499244928359985,0.5454553365707397,0.359267920255661,0.3088643252849579,0.6645783185958862,0.6281442642211914,0.5514543652534485,0,0.39363986253738403,0.1708531230688095,0.6048800945281982,0.4020627439022064,0.5750851035118103,0.2560250461101532,0.3252372741699219,0.667643129825592,0.20487962663173676,0.3792458772659302,0.4872410297393799,0.3060901165008545,0.7245922088623047,0.6184117197990417,0.31153878569602966,0.18309934437274933,0.5389549136161804,0.6198248863220215,0.7011497020721436,0.7647064924240112

1247,"So the options are either dying in misery or living in misery, either will hurt others and either will be considered ones own fault. You can force someone to stay alive, or to die, but you can't force anyone to truly live, not even yourself. It's kind of an unfair expectation.","It is unfair. Modern psychology/psychiatry is completely incapable of helping those who are in severe pain with lifelong battles with mental illness. It often feels like we are just vehicles of pain who live so that others don't suffer from grief should we commit suicide. As we develop a greater sensitivity to the cost of mental illness, policies and social norms will change: Some countries now allow for euthanasia for those with chronic and unbearable mental illness. But what's strange about all of this is, even though I'm certain I have the right to kill myself because I'm miserable everyday, I am pulling for you to live, even though you're a stranger on the internet. I have hope for you and I don't even know you. I want you to wait it out, to battle it out, not because you owe me or anyone else, but because I think there might be something better for you in a day or a week or a decade from now. What have you tried so far to get some relief? Has anything worked? What can you do that brings you moments of enjoyment?",1,2,2,1,0.5145136117935181,0.16458940505981445,0.4762648642063141,0.3845115303993225,0.5963793992996216,0.2718138098716736,0.24886766076087952,0.6107946634292603,0.05406039208173752,0.4773968458175659,0.45206648111343384,0.4348648190498352,0.5121911764144897,0.5895088911056519,0.3325265347957611,0.3133760988712311,0.5737324357032776,0.5309773683547974,0.6987165212631226,0.8490191698074341,0,0.43284985423088074,0.1443900316953659,0.5939728617668152,0.40923812985420227,0.5465313792228699,0.2691062390804291,0.27155593037605286,0.6478379964828491,0.2160806804895401,0.37354427576065063,0.4739397466182709,0.295737087726593,0.669342041015625,0.6092208623886108,0.3339140713214874,0.19452202320098877,0.5540892481803894,0.6327476501464844,0.7255394458770752,0.6935087442398071

You absolutely must have all your ducks in a row before you run a business. Your ego gets caught up in it, so when it is having rough times you feel like crap, and when it's doing well you need to use that to prepare for when it inevitably isn't. It can be done, but it's expensive in terms of money, your sanity, health and any relationships that might otherwise happen (however unlikely).

1284,"I managed to even fail this.. I attempted suicide on the 15th, and failed. After waking up it was soul-crushing and made me feel even worse. How do some people feel better if they fail? I'm sorry, just don't have anyone else to say this to.","I find that how you view failure is tied to your expectations quite heavily. Or also the pressure of feeling others' expectations of you on your shoulders. I still haven't worked things out that I'm able to effectively handle failure myself, but mainly people can feel better when they fail, because they recognise it as a learning experience, or it is an inevitable part of the process. Now this may sound obvious, but when in the moment, it is very easy to forget this and lose sight of progress after the failure. Failure can appear in many forms. My expectation of a 'good outcome', instead was a horrible mistake... Or was it? I'm sorry to hear you feeling even worse after your suicide attempt.

1308,"I'm living paycheck to paycheck - will be working until I'm dead. I have $16 in my wallet, a handful of change in my car ashtray, and $27.xx in my bank account to last me until next Friday (payday). I hate being poor.","What types of jobs are you applying for? I ask because every single job (since graduating college) I've ever had has been a job where the company required a degree, but the job itself didn't necessary need the skills provided by a degree. They used the degree as a way to weed people out. I have a BA as well, and student debt, but I don't feel like it wasn't worth anything. Even though I took a pay cut with my new job (for better benefits), my income is still more than the average income for a family where I live. I say this because, at this point, you can't change that you got a BA. You just gotta accept it and don't dwell on the I should have dones because if you do, you'll just fuck yourself over and the negativity will eat you alive. Now, you just gotta make a plan - what can you do with your degree? What are some skills you learned from your degree and previous jobs that can transfer over to something else? Is there anything at all you can cut from your budget? Get a roomie? Etc. Plans suck and when you're already depressed, the are the last things you want to be worried about, but it's hard to change things you don't like without one. If you keep up the job search (and work any connections you have), you may be able to find something better.

I want other people to be happy, I don't want them to feel the same as me.","I understand your thought process but hiding or lying will make it worse for you and for them (when they find out the truth). I have adopted a policy of soft truth when talking about depression with loved ones. Let me explain: There is some drama inherent to despair - you feel all alone, like nothing will ever get better, you feel like you're choking on it, etc. And that's a lot for normal people to deal with. So I try to state the facts like a robot and not be super descriptive or let myself get too worked up. Keeping my cool helps them do the same, and it's not really a lie, I'm just choosing how much I want to express. It's like I'm a bottle of soda that's been really shaken up, and if you take the cap off like normal it's going to explode all over your face. But if you do it really slowly you let the carbonation out in a manageable way and then you can drink your soda and everyone's happy.",1,0,2,1,0.4969850182533264,0.3395652174949646,0.43219736218452454,0.2917753756046295,0.38719841837882996,0.29041588306427,0.580019474029541,0.6272454857826233,0.4645145535469055,0.49913084506988525,0.5277343392372131,0.5093854665756226,0.5577860474586487,0.5885943174362183,0.4558940827846527,0.19548019766807556,0.4211226999759674,0.5642896890640259,0.6532120704650879,0.5011955499649048,0,0.43924692273139954,0.23185347020626068,0.543228268623352,0.39707663655281067,0.5355522632598877,0.23616063594818115,0.41580915451049805,0.6070533990859985,0.2285218983888626,0.42311525344848633,0.5104017853736877,0.34158337116241455,0.6707513332366943,0.5760347247123718,0.3643852174282074,0.21533800661563873,0.5598465800285339,0.6125773787498474,0.7079848051071167,0.711313784122467

1323,Anyone feel numb/epmpty. I don't really know of its depression but I figured you guys could help.

1324,I'm sad because:. I can't connect.  I have no friends.  I have no lover.  I have no motivation.  Life is uneventful.  People are not good to each other.  I don't care enough to try.   I'm afraid of trying.  Afraid that this is all there will ever be for me.,"I can agree with every single thing you have listed there, and experience them all. It is not normal for a 24 year old good looking, well educated man to be feeling this way - but I have never felt right in life. The biggest thing that kills me is that I have never experienced a relationship or genuine friendship in my life. I find myself completely and utterly alone every day. My only communication is with my clients by email. I do leave the house, but it's only to go to the grocery store or for a walk - by myself of course.

1336,.... Is it ok for feel sorry for my self,"Life is not what happens to you - it's how you react to it. If you feel sorry for yourself, and most depressed people do, it's because they decide that there is a payoff in doing it. It's showing sympathy for a person, and you're the person, because you aren't getting it from anyone else. It all comes down to what comes after that. You can give up and never try again, or you can take that feeling and extend it into the future: - Imagine feeling this way, and doing nothing about it, for a year. 5 years. 10 years. What has your life become? - Now imagine what your life would be like if you forced yourself to get of bed, brush your teeth, went to the store or coffee shop, talked to someone, helped someone, every day. Now imagine doing that for a year. 5 years. 10 years. NOW what is your life like?",0,0,0,1,0.6023108959197998,0.18004094064235687,0.7939170002937317,0.402556449174881,0.6662251949310303,0.35385122895240784,0.4628952443599701,0.46667513251304626,0.10349053144454956,0.5135658383369446,0.5598953366279602,0.4414355158805847,0.6377663016319275,0.5388466119766235,0.4366741180419922,0.4104565978050232,0.8025479316711426,0.48642465472221375,0.6368815898895264,0.7864283919334412,0,0.4477986991405487,0.26045823097229004,0.5896944999694824,0.3781643211841583,0.5008385181427002,0.23911315202713013,0.29648348689079285,0.6290379762649536,0.31592872738838196,0.4038112759590149,0.5328394770622253,0.3372531533241272,0.6725410223007202,0.6446775197982788,0.316649466753006,0.18992631137371063,0.5524194836616516,0.6353871822357178,0.7053260207176208,0.6039953827857971

1345,I hate my life so fucking much right now.. I hate myself so much. Why is life so difficult. Constant self loathing. just sitting by the computer all day. Doing nothing. I'm just a fat ugly virgin loser. I hate this life. I hate myself. I didn't ask to be born in the first place... Why am i expected to accept life as it is then? Ugh...,"I looked at your post history(sorry, I'm nosy) and what caught my eye was that you were upset that you feel girls don't find you attractive. The key there was you said you don't even bother talking to them. A fear of rejection is what keeps most people single, I think. Even just smiling at a girl when she walks by might make you feel better. If she gives you that, What do you want, weirdo? look, that's her insecurity, and those aren't the kind of people you want in your life anyways. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. My problem is the opposite, I'm skinny as a rail and short. Upon putting myself out there, I found that some people actually think I'm attractive. You're your own worst critic, so I sincerely doubt your just un-lovably ugly. And about your weight, treat it like an RPG, make a game of losing weight. You'll start to feel better about yourself the more you lose. It can be kind of fun to work on yourself, especially when you start to see results. I was talking to my parents the other day, and calorie counting apparently worked wonders on them. Do some research and see what's best for you, I'm no doctor.

But the thing is that if you were to kill your self they would feel unimaginable pain and guilt. They may learn to cope with the pain but they will find ways to blame it on themselves. They will think it because they did or do something and it will haunt them for life.

1378,"Sadness is often caused by a discrepancy between where you are and where you want to be Help. What if your life has unmet expectations, that will never be realized. Since my first memory I've been distant, depressed, passive and unhappy for this reason. I'm old enough to realize now that this will never go away. I can't let go, it has gotten worse with unfortunate life events(lost the opportunity of a life time that will never be recovered). I just can't stop wanting change, change that doesn't exist in this world. Therapy didn't work, meds are uncertain because studies keep pointing towards how bad or ineffective they are and I don't want to risk it for the long term anyways, meditation helped a bit but it will never fill this void that I have. Life has become unbearable and I am already past the human will power. People think that this temporary, I've been doing research on the internet every night for the past 5 years and I came to the conclusion that it is not. Mercy on my tormented mind","That is a very true definition of sadness. Just out of curiosity, why wouldn't you want to take a risk of trying different medications that might help you? You don't know how they affect you, until you try them. You state that things are unbearable now, so it seems worthwhile to try something that might help you to be happier - even if it causes a side effect of growing a 2nd big toe on your right foot! :)  The internet is hard to scientifically research complicated subjects. Most of the better data &amp; studies are not accessible or behind paywalls.  I hope that you are feeling a little better. We get new opportunities every day, but it is hard to get over mistakes in the past sometimes. Unfortunately, we can't change the past, until I finish the time machine that I'm working on in my basement. :) Feel free to contribute to my Kickstarter fundraiser! :)",1,2,0,1,0.4600469768047333,0.26978370547294617,0.5078616738319397,0.35348349809646606,0.5796881318092346,0.31720995903015137,0.4507688283920288,0.47805824875831604,0.2353799194097519,0.4849807322025299,0.49378395080566406,0.3235664367675781,0.5982455015182495,0.5688212513923645,0.3511229455471039,0.38368695974349976,0.5648370385169983,0.6643266677856445,0.7794193625450134,0.8049601316452026,0,0.46164146065711975,0.18160641193389893,0.48074963688850403,0.3477734923362732,0.49549323320388794,0.2641667127609253,0.3664301633834839,0.505333423614502,0.258841335773468,0.3793193995952606,0.4638737738132477,0.30931204557418823,0.6184811592102051,0.5318117737770081,0.3413147032260895,0.2937898635864258,0.5231035947799683,0.6395936012268066,0.7114413976669312,0.6813711524009705

1461,"Depression and capitalism. Does anyone else feel the way we have set up our western societies has helped trigger depression? I know when I think about life, surviving constantly but never happy, never truly living I become immortalised in depression and anger. Sometimes I feel buying land, living with a bunch of like minded folks and working as a mini community would help my feelings of utter contempt for life.","Lmao that's my plan honestly. Got sick of it, can't stomach shelling out $700+ a month when I earn $8 an hour just for a shitty apartment I'll never have time to spend in because I'm worried about making the rent for it. It's depressing and monotonous. I'm personally building a van to live out of right now, I plan to leave in the summer. I think of you have any itch to get out there and do something that makes you feel whole you should do it. I've dealt with depression long enough and frankly I'm sick of it, so I'm trying something a little new. Travel, fresh people, fresh scenes, fresh work. It won't be the most luxurious life but it'll probably provide more than the norm of working all day every day.",0,0,1,1,0.6042512655258179,0.2582116723060608,0.4902094304561615,0.4162817597389221,0.4667794406414032,0.2523581087589264,0.3980097472667694,0.5500985383987427,0.2854461073875427,0.5661585330963135,0.47954902052879333,0.47056108713150024,0.44783374667167664,0.5950210690498352,0.4310974180698395,0.26118361949920654,0.4223046600818634,0.5825849175453186,0.6879744529724121,0.7502236366271973,0,0.43822482228279114,0.24604234099388123,0.5375047922134399,0.34545430541038513,0.5412030220031738,0.24065656960010529,0.39006325602531433,0.5062102675437927,0.23674695193767548,0.44711214303970337,0.5211799144744873,0.35899537801742554,0.6260250806808472,0.5001436471939087,0.3592475354671478,0.22041912376880646,0.4954453408718109,0.6062512397766113,0.7091509103775024,0.7791374325752258

1466,"My girlfriend left me. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. It feels as though anyone I truly love betrays me, it's not easy for me to open up to anyone, to truly have trust for them and any form of care is extremely difficult for me. And this just reinforces my belief that I can't trust anyone. I gave her everything, I cared for her when she was down despite me living in hell for years, treated her, loved her and she leaves me for a complete scumbag who is notorius for fucking women over then moving onto the next one. So fuck you depression and fuck the pair of those pricks.","I'll give you the /relationships answer: Hit the lawyer, delete the gym. Or like, the other way around. I know, not married, but it still cheers me up to say that :) Some people are shit. But mostly, people are clueless. People are at different places, different stages in their life. Find any average girl in her late twenties or older, and they'll likely be able to tell you some things they did to dudes they weren't proud of after the fact, but at the time, seemed like the most sane and logical thing, something they needed to do. Guys do the same, just in a different manner. On both sides, it hurts like hell, and is something everyone goes through. Focus on yourself. Not the Tony Robbins rah-rah go you! I mean depression hits, end of relationships suck, they mess with your head and your body. Gym is good because it helps both your self confidence and makes both your body and your head feel better.

1504,A close friend told me that I should do what I want and I'd be much happier.. My first thought was suicide.,What? As long as it's not directly physically hurting another person you should always do whatever makes you happy. And if it's suicide then that's not wrong. For some people suicide is the answer.

But to many people it's not worth continuing to live with something that they've dealt with for years at a chance of having it magically get cured.,1,1,0,1,0.30477264523506165,0.2397339642047882,0.6306278705596924,0.35110312700271606,0.5837631821632385,0.3382963538169861,0.38930049538612366,0.6205064654350281,0.15004296600818634,0.5570270419120789,0.5336079001426697,0.4087603688240051,0.6696778535842896,0.5438605546951294,0.3964062035083771,0.2662043273448944,0.5659850239753723,0.6734673380851746,0.7356004118919373,0.7734087109565735,0,0.3982386887073517,0.14820940792560577,0.5794785022735596,0.4147682785987854,0.5477660894393921,0.2356032282114029,0.30675244331359863,0.6426878571510315,0.166966050863266,0.3490505814552307,0.4711439609527588,0.27065640687942505,0.7134977579116821,0.5266420245170593,0.2713591158390045,0.1331578642129898,0.553863525390625,0.6182318329811096,0.6597005724906921,0.6860048770904541

1555,"I seem to always be the first to try and help someone else with their problems, yet when I need help nobody seems to be around to be an open ear for me, I wish I had someone in real life who cared enough to listen to me and just let me spill everything out. Anyone else feel this way?","I'm not entirely certain what reaction you're getting, but I hope you'll give those around you a little slack if they can't be as openly receptive and caring as you need at first. I'm sort of the designated problem solver in my circle, so quite a few of my friends come to me for advice and sympathy. It's never, never a burden. Instead, it's an honor. They trust me with their secrets, their problems, and value my opinion enough to ask for it. Reverse the situation. Aren't you glad when someone comes to you? The thing is, not everyone is built for that. Especially, I have found, it can sort of weird people out when the Rock, the Stable One, the One Person In This Messed Up World Who Has Their Stuff Together needs help. I mean, here's the person they go to and they rely on when they need support... and that person needs support. Suddenly you're not Superman anymore and it can be a bit disconcerting. Perhaps try introducing A problem at a time, slowly, and seeing if they can get used to you also being a normal human with issues.

You can't tell someone that their therapist cares about them because you care about the kids you look after.",0,0,2,1,0.441326767206192,0.23397837579250336,0.6116385459899902,0.3011114001274109,0.457007497549057,0.30959266424179077,0.34890028834342957,0.6476082801818848,0.18921911716461182,0.5436399579048157,0.49737849831581116,0.4378422200679779,0.6545765399932861,0.7759948372840881,0.422112375497818,0.3386583924293518,0.5704506039619446,0.5743672251701355,0.6468360424041748,0.6330356597900391,0,0.3716895878314972,0.1320727914571762,0.6536282300949097,0.42473432421684265,0.5448216199874878,0.2475155144929886,0.35266968607902527,0.6752564311027527,0.16202880442142487,0.36799806356430054,0.46106547117233276,0.2519657611846924,0.7397565245628357,0.5304908752441406,0.30372342467308044,0.10204394161701202,0.5255717635154724,0.6536496877670288,0.6636756062507629,0.6210170984268188

1607,"Does anyone else's depression make them feel stupid or slow?. I have trouble holding conversations because of the brain fog I experience but also because I can't seem to connect the thoughts in my mind enough to form a clear sentence. I used to have deep conversations with friends on subjects like art, film, photography, history, etc. But now I can't participate in them on a deep and stimulating level. I feel so stupid because I can't respond to people clearly during a conversation. ( I know I don't have ADHD) Can anyone else relate?",Yes. I also have anxiety issues so if I'm not fumbling my words because of that I'm struggling to follow my own thought process because of the fog.

1615,I don't Know If This Is Normal Or Not. I always feel like i'm a loser and not worth people's time is that considered a form of depression ?,"not really a form of depression, but it can definitely be a symptom of it. Feeling that you are worthless, a burden, a failure, are all very common to those suffering from depression. What separates it from simply having low self esteem, which many people do, are whether or not you have the other symptoms associated with depression. Things like lack of energy and interest, hopelessness about the future, difficulty sleeping/eating/focusing, suicidal thoughts; experiencing these things on a consistent basis for weeks/months/years is definitely indicative of some sort of depression. Take some time and think about how you feel and been causing it, Do some research into your thoughts and what others say about it. If you decide you need or want help, be afraid to reach out to others and communicate your troubles. I wish you the best of luck, you got this.",1,0,0,1,0.5163078308105469,0.17783762514591217,0.5229437351226807,0.3993526101112366,0.6084886193275452,0.28842437267303467,0.45456016063690186,0.547340989112854,0.1506781429052353,0.5109795331954956,0.45187678933143616,0.38855066895484924,0.5192480683326721,0.5450558662414551,0.3214389383792877,0.21089120209217072,0.5310942530632019,0.49337780475616455,0.6095079779624939,0.7118096351623535,0,0.4596816599369049,0.18396885693073273,0.5564672946929932,0.37078455090522766,0.6031101942062378,0.2634842097759247,0.28874069452285767,0.5614417791366577,0.20138154923915863,0.4348592162132263,0.46215128898620605,0.3160606920719147,0.6627568602561951,0.5412415862083435,0.2897365391254425,0.17420653998851776,0.5722329020500183,0.61722332239151,0.7155733108520508,0.8015145659446716

1659,"Cyclothymia. I have just been diagnosed with cyclothymia and am terrified because changing my meds. My meds been working the greatest, but so scared to switch them up. Does anyone else have experience with cyclothymia? just now for the first time in my life recognizing the symptoms I have.","I was diagnosed with it when I was 15, and I am 22 now. For my antidepressant, I tried lexapro ( which i stopped taking; because, it made my dick stop working), and wellbutrin.. which was alright. My antipsychotic was risperidone.. which I honestly am still dealing with a side affect of it till this day. I'll be honest, I took those combination of drugs for like 2.5 years, and just stopped. I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life. Whether it was for childhood epilepsy, ADHD, depression, and the last diagnosis cyclothymia. Was hospitalized twice before I got the cyclothymia diagnosis, and it was pretty bad at one point, and looking back.. I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey. Work with your psychiatrist and maybe even work with a therapist if you can. Do all you can do to find the proper treatment, and YOU WILL BE OKAY.

1664,"Drunk now. So I'm drunk while writing this on my phone but trying to make readable. This girl broke up with me back in late December. Before that happened I was pretty depressed but pretended I wasn't. That's basically what ruined things between us. Since the break up I've been trying to clean myself up.

1669,"What's the point?. Why am I supposed to stay alive? I don't want to reproduce and I don't care for anyone in my life. I don't see a point, especially if I'm just going to die in the end.","It's a sad reality that everything comes to an end and that we're not given an exact explanation of why we're here or what the meaning of it all is. The way I see it is that we're here to give our life meaning one way or another. Since we don't know the meaning we have to make the meaning. Some people find that through their work, family, helping others, etc. Life is full of endless possibilities of what we can do with it. It's hard getting to the point where we feel like we're happy or accomplished but that in itself is another aspect of life and finding meaning. For some people it could take most of their lives to find the meaning that they were looking for and in my view I'd rather spend my whole life looking for that meaning and helping who I can along the way than to just accept that there's no meaning to it and end it since that's not really an answer. I may never get the answer myself but I can at least enjoy the journey leading to the end and maybe that in and of itself was the meaning all along. You'll meet many varieties of people throughout your life who will give you different perspectives of what meaning is to them and maybe that will help you on your journey and maybe it won't. We have the time we're given and what we do with it is dependent on us. Even after we die and join the rest of the universe in it's infinite there'll still be people around who will say, Hey remember u/OkayScience, I want to do what he did and live my life to its fullest. We can still be remembered for the life we lived even after we're gone and in that way we'll essentially live forever. This is the way I see life and it helps me from time to time. I still have my bad days and sometimes consider if it's all worth it but then I just keep going because I won't know if I just stop here. Plus it helps talking to people about it at times and if you do feel like talking about it more feel free to send me a message. Keep going with the journey and stay strong since you'll find your meaning in time.",1,0,0,1,0.5248357057571411,0.19107256829738617,0.5436069369316101,0.30994197726249695,0.5372588038444519,0.27176302671432495,0.5821002125740051,0.5661846995353699,0.16586516797542572,0.5593492984771729,0.5301839113235474,0.4781428575515747,0.5609240531921387,0.48857733607292175,0.40625321865081787,0.2220049649477005,0.48178064823150635,0.5218930244445801,0.6584002375602722,0.7105239033699036,0,0.45877906680107117,0.20855921506881714,0.4462093412876129,0.4066905677318573,0.4567023813724518,0.2758103013038635,0.3626120686531067,0.5607956647872925,0.35974082350730896,0.370345801115036,0.5186088681221008,0.2947629690170288,0.6292291879653931,0.5904655456542969,0.2454225867986679,0.02487671747803688,0.5658085346221924,0.6523497104644775,0.6921238899230957,0.46769237518310547

1681,"Yesterday was the worst day of my life, but compared to today, yesterday was good.. This has been my every day for the last years of my life. I needed only one thing to be right in life, so that I could hold on to it. And now that there is nothing, I don't know what to do because I feel I am nothing.","It's a terrible feeling when you try to hold on to even the most minuscule things that bring you any slight amount of joy, and one by one those things get taken from you. What I try to do is work back on a route to the thing that would lead to getting the one thing that could be right. i.e. something that costs money makes you happy, but you don't make enough money; need a way to make more money; dedicate all free time to applying for better work. Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed. Honestly, I know it's not that easy a fix, and there will be more bumps to overcome. One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people. But generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable, even just through reading online about how to get started, can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it won't be like that forever, and that there is a physical, tangible, mortal way to deal with the situation. So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap. Helps you take it day by day a little easier, and I hope that would make each new day, if not better, at least consistent for you. Feel better soon, bud.",1,0,2,1,0.5197544097900391,0.3216973543167114,0.4585592448711395,0.1650441437959671,0.4730929136276245,0.31172436475753784,0.48563727736473083,0.5645604133605957,0.2985101044178009,0.5239375829696655,0.5430675148963928,0.5235768556594849,0.5110213756561279,0.39230531454086304,0.491311639547348,0.2717755138874054,0.4300808012485504,0.5339178442955017,0.6384055614471436,0.6805934906005859,0,0.37076884508132935,0.09176080673933029,0.39999887347221375,0.4191208779811859,0.5316604375839233,0.27553239464759827,0.35667210817337036,0.5075979232788086,0.11656372249126434,0.385545551776886,0.4913550317287445,0.11827303469181061,0.6443270444869995,0.44853338599205017,0.3083662688732147,-0.1981801837682724,0.5325947999954224,0.6527304649353027,0.6156070828437805,0.6342243552207947

1704,My bf told me to cheer up because my life is not that hard. I have never been so close to hitting another person. It made me so angry that he said that to me.,"Dude. This feeling, I know it, and sadly, this is a common go-to response for a lot of people who simply have nothing better to contribute. It's out of context and beside the point in essence. It's a variation of the ever popular At least you aren't a starving kid in [insert country here]! and more generally It could be worse! Like, yes, thanks very much Captain Obvious, everything is relative, but that's beside the point? It's invalidating, insensitive and snobby, at best, and I have no idea if it helps you feel any better, but when a lot of people say it, they do think they're doing some genuine good to help you feel better, despite being wildly misinformed on how hurtful that phrase actually is. My boyfriend said this to me more frequently in the past and after YEARS of explaining why this is not a good response, he's slowly using it less, but when it pops up, my typical counter is That does not help me/make me feel better at all, and that typically shuts him up or at least makes him think about what he just said. In any case, I'm sorry you had that shitty non-reason response thrown at you. What you're going through is real and valid, even if others choose not to acknowledge it.",2,0,2,1,0.37651562690734863,0.22496603429317474,0.8001795411109924,0.3843177258968353,0.5365477204322815,0.31226348876953125,0.42670461535453796,0.7295463681221008,0.12500622868537903,0.5244712233543396,0.5071401000022888,0.4341794550418854,0.7001307606697083,0.7861224412918091,0.41275516152381897,0.3103216290473938,0.5183130502700806,0.551206111907959,0.720869779586792,0.8657481074333191,0,0.43207061290740967,0.1450549215078354,0.5348267555236816,0.43868085741996765,0.5657341480255127,0.2565162777900696,0.30149605870246887,0.5889536738395691,0.17653095722198486,0.3271956443786621,0.4712965786457062,0.2541227340698242,0.5918124914169312,0.620042622089386,0.2771083414554596,0.12996399402618408,0.5913616418838501,0.6240309476852417,0.7112155556678772,0.6623001098632812

1713,Does anyone know how to study when they're depressed?. I can't find the strength to do anything. It's almost as if my mind has turned off.,"That has to be tough. It's different strokes for different folks of course but I might have a suggestion. I find my depression tends to be racing negative thoughts. My understanding is that there are two default brain modes, one is random thought, day dreaming for example, and the other is processing. So you need to switch from day dreaming to processing, and that is hard for everyone. Start with meditation. Close your eyes for 5min and focus on your breathing. If your thoughts drift from breathing, then shut it down n snap back to breathing. Don't get emotional, just stay calm and focus on breathing. When finished, move everything that is a distraction away from you. No phone, no internet if possible, just clear that shit away and start studying as if it is your breathing. This focus is just like a muscle and the more you flex the stronger it will become. Don't expect to focus for hours on end, but try to catch yourself when you drift and get back to that focus. Also make studying fun, or less boring. Take notes, highlight pages, repeat the things you read. Most importantly, try telling a story with what you are learning. It's a strong method for memorization. People with ordinary memories use stories and codes to memorize full decks of cards in minutes.

1752,I want it to end.. I don't know how much further I can go. I'm extremely depressed. I've got a gun and bullets. I just can't anymore,"There isn't a lot I can say or do that will really help you at this point in time. If you are feeling this low in your life that you want to die nothing I nor anyone else can say to change your mind but I will try my best to do what I can. There are people around you who can help you. Hospitals, doctors, therapist and counsellors. Over 20% of the worlds population deal with mental illness and seeing another person give in would be heartbreaking. Sadness is a passing feeling but depression is long term however it is recoverable. Things might be horrible right now but I promise you if you reach out and get help you can do this. You can get pass this difficult stage and these feelings will eventually leave. But perhaps you've already tried to get help and it hasn't worked. If so, thats ok. Therapy doesn't work for everyone but we can find a way to help you get out of this state so please before picking up that gun think of everything you will be leaving behind. Right now it may feel like you're alone and no one cares, but you won't know what truly will happen if you're dead. You won't be able to see people you love anymore, hear sounds of music or voices, see colours and people around you. A life you could have lived. You will be in an internal slumber, this is not a temporary way of dealing with this so please think this over. You can message me. I might not know how you are feeling right now but I will definitely be a person to listen and try to understand. I believe in you.",1,0,0,1,0.39932650327682495,0.22747643291950226,0.6435776352882385,0.36972352862358093,0.7053912878036499,0.5418626070022583,0.6176659464836121,0.5131925940513611,0.159919872879982,0.5307440161705017,0.5238307118415833,0.5379148721694946,0.39769119024276733,0.4295257329940796,0.42702069878578186,0.32463526725769043,0.6853970289230347,0.5430615544319153,0.5903507471084595,0.7376912236213684,0,0.49192485213279724,0.29299283027648926,0.47266480326652527,0.26815202832221985,0.60450679063797,0.33974286913871765,0.41090574860572815,0.5137135982513428,0.16538064181804657,0.3817524313926697,0.5144979357719421,0.3626335859298706,0.6081273555755615,0.4350473880767822,0.24346031248569489,0.35900577902793884,0.5233274102210999,0.6601586937904358,0.7336478233337402,0.7945701479911804

1780,"Advice on how to date a depressed person?. I am in love with my boyfriend for him. Unfortunately, he has battled depression long before me. I love him, but loving him can be so hard. It hurts when he becomes distant when his emotions become overwhelming. It hurts when he becomes upset. I know he is going through an extremely tough mental battle, so I refrain from telling him my thoughts. I have got him to seek help (antidepressants). He has begun opening up to his friends and family. I am very happy for him! I am proud of how far he has progressed. He loves me a lot, and depends on me for his hapiness. It is difficult making him happy when his depression is taking a toll on me. I have sacrificed so much of my hapiness for him, and all in the name of love. Right now, he is spending time with his friends and BEING HAPPY while I am at home worrying about him and thinking of ways in which I can be a better girlfriend. I am choosing to prioritize his emotions over mine because he is a good person who deserves to happy. Any advice on dating a depressed person?","Dating a depressed person is like dating a child with temper tantrums. I suggest you to focus on your own happiness first, then be there to support them when they need you. You are ultimately two individuals with individual needs and ideals. Live and let live, support and be supported are the key. You are at this point just dating and you must remember that you shouldn't give more than what you must. It should be a harmony where equal emotional exchange is the mandate. Otherwise it takes a toll lime it is right now and if things go sour it will be your fault and you are bound to hurt the most because you gave more than you had and got lesser in return. Balance is key, communication is the order.

1833,"Thinking of the future. When I think of the future, I feel so worthless. I feel like I will never achieve anything great after finishing university. It makes me feel more depressed about being alive. How do you cope with the future?","I try to cope by trying to keep my own goals from the past that were broken, alongside those i may make in the current time, intact for myself. Whether or not that can happen or if it's meant to be for me, i don't and honestly can't know, unless and until i get there from still trying. I am living, but not alive -- there is a difference; I'm trying to find completion for that void. I try to accept myself and my flaws -- even some of the current ones i want gone as i progress towards that. I still fight myself over that and/or other things at times. But i still try to accept and understand. I just keep going. For the sake of something i still believe in somewhere out there that might be befitting of me, as i want it. If it's there, i must get to it -- i must have it. At the same time, i must better myself until i am who and what I've always wanted to be, both in and out. The sense of failure and futility are always there -- i just keep trying to keep them level and not overwhelm me. I try to do things for myself i thought i had from others. Things i would truly want done to me by others. But there's nobody. I got used to it. Despite still wanting the opposite in my own humble way. I just think of what who might actually still exist out there, think and feel if i weren't doing this, willingly, to keep pushing. I keep trying to believe that regardless, i deserve things my way. After everything especially. That it can't all be for naught. I've yet to see that. That's why I'm still going for the future. Even if its path got shattered long-ago, many-a-time. I hope this helps.",0,0,1,1,0.58558589220047,0.39522916078567505,0.4773731529712677,0.260331928730011,0.4887675940990448,0.2909577488899231,0.44010844826698303,0.5563639402389526,0.36118966341018677,0.5533185005187988,0.5716865658760071,0.5119045972824097,0.4831669330596924,0.6779465675354004,0.41922691464424133,0.20611627399921417,0.3703557550907135,0.6557847261428833,0.7525511980056763,0.5748867392539978,0,0.4973900318145752,0.3972870111465454,0.31410273909568787,0.1731768697500229,0.5251069068908691,0.2556280493736267,0.5114318132400513,0.45386746525764465,0.3186194896697998,0.5314474105834961,0.5271944999694824,0.4306144714355469,0.5880040526390076,0.5181105732917786,0.5199317932128906,0.21969790756702423,0.5446097254753113,0.6308799982070923,0.8094521760940552,0.7299566864967346

1835,Should you kill yourself if you have no social life?. Should you kill yourself if you have no social life?,"No. Not having a social life isn't a terminal diagnosis. Why kill yourself due to lack of social life if you could eventually obtain one? Life is not pass/fail. It's not about getting a certain grade for social life, or any other aspect of life for that matter. You are not a failure. Not having friends worsens depression, depression inhibits the ability to make friends. It's a cycle that needs to be broken, and I recommend getting medical help to tackle depression. Eventually you will get to a point where it is easier to make/maintain relationships, even if it that progress seems small at first.

1854,When does it get better?. I wasted the 'best years of my life' in highschool being depressed. Now I'm equally depressed in uni when I should be having even more fun partying and learning new things. What am I waiting for? Being even more depressed in an office job? It's too much..,"That whole best years of your life thing, at least in my opinion, is a load of hogwash. Best years? Body going through changes? Trying to figure out your first relationships? Stuck in school all day? Drama everywhere? Restricted in everything you want to do? Inexperienced enough to not know what you really want to do? I could go on... HS sucks. With very few exceptions, the only people I know who consider HS the best years are people who are completely and totally miserable adults who are looking back with rose-colored glasses at a time when their parents paid for everything. College is better for most people, but the partying and crap is highly overrated once you're old enough to look back a bit. I don't know anyone who misses that stuff. But what are the best years? I think once you hit your mid-20s things really start to look up. Odds are, your career is at least starting to actually materialize, you aren't as emotionally immature anymore and things don't bother you like they used to, and generally speaking the odds are that things are more stable overall. Don't sell your future short--you'll look back and realize there's a lot of crap in HS/college that you'll be glad to have behind you!!",1,0,0,1,0.5584883689880371,0.21791952848434448,0.3216390013694763,0.271812379360199,0.5474750995635986,0.26139703392982483,0.48464301228523254,0.44686031341552734,0.09970296919345856,0.4541753828525543,0.3973149359226227,0.5046010613441467,0.42660269141197205,0.3683291971683502,0.40938296914100647,0.31461766362190247,0.443838894367218,0.4282201826572418,0.5070004463195801,0.6961434483528137,0,0.43287286162376404,0.1229960024356842,0.41417571902275085,0.4774205982685089,0.6250896453857422,0.26377707719802856,0.2651895582675934,0.6010984182357788,0.22608022391796112,0.3091815412044525,0.5350868105888367,0.3026522397994995,0.5879124999046326,0.6402571201324463,0.21803419291973114,0.16087158024311066,0.675406813621521,0.6018445491790771,0.693117082118988,0.6835651993751526
1855,do you avoid making decisions when you're depressed?. Knowing that your ability to make informed and clear decisions may be clouded by your depression. Do you put them off for times that you're feeling not as depressed? Kind of a make hay while the sun shines kind of thinking.,"I do this involuntarily, and it can get bad, fast. I freeze when it becomes severe; I start running scenarios in my head and I get anxious considering the possibilities. It might be that the outcome in either case is equally good, or I feel underinformed about the possibilities of one case, or what I really know I want to do has a potential worst-case that seems way more likely than it really is because I can't process over my own internal noise, but whatever it is, I just go essentially blank while my brain feels too broken to work it out.

1869,I feel like I'm so depressed that it's hard to even pretend to be happy. Does anyone else feel this way?,"Pretending to be happy can be extremely hard, no matter if depressed or not. Sure, depression doesn't make it any easier, thats a fact. Do you have someone you can talk to? For example have a really deep conversation, tell them about your biggest fears? Where you dont have to pretend to be happy? Wearing a mask is exhausting as hell, and the longer you try to keep it up, the more explosive will it be, when you can't hold it up any longer. In that regard, I speak from experience. And last but not least, it's completely fine to not feel happy sometimes. You just have to feel sad, out of the loop, neglected, rejected or even hated sometimes. Those are the moments where you really analyze yourself and your doings, (something you should keep under control, because too much of it is destructive), and if you embrace it, roll with it, telling yourself that this is natural and just a response of something inside you, you can't really pinpoint yet, those times could actually end up being beneficial for you. Noone feels 100% happy all the time, and if so, I'd call them liars. If you want, shoot me a pm, anytime! Keep your head up! please!",1,2,2,1,0.5529667139053345,0.21380403637886047,0.6347142457962036,0.41310739517211914,0.5745894312858582,0.29776525497436523,0.4023338854312897,0.6546980738639832,0.2153898924589157,0.5845458507537842,0.5392845273017883,0.4299941062927246,0.5403027534484863,0.7133405208587646,0.38902175426483154,0.2478218972682953,0.4737568795681,0.4991740584373474,0.6538254022598267,0.7985370755195618,0,0.298664927482605,0.13309790194034576,0.535254716873169,0.4097834527492523,0.4854370057582855,0.24427245557308197,0.4499369263648987,0.6273014545440674,0.09457181394100189,0.41788989305496216,0.3989488184452057,0.17723165452480316,0.799321174621582,0.5019439458847046,0.3374567925930023,-0.1885146200656891,0.48006412386894226,0.6072288155555725,0.6213794350624084,0.8280746936798096

1872,baffled. Does love even exist? like true actual love? halfway convinced that it,"Love does exist. But our modern unrealistic rendition of what it is aka the so-called Real Love unfortunately doesn't. Humans are fallible and imperfect. We can't expect them to have emotions that are perfect let alone those that remain constant forever. That said, if you go in a relationship where you both embrace each other's imperfections and be honest then I don't know if it will be perfect but at least you won't drown in regrets and disappointments if it breaks up.

There has to be something in your life, big or small, that makes you feel in a good way. For me I felt like I couldn't have any good emotions. Only bad ones. I sat down one day and really thought about my life. When I'm with my friends I usually can feel good. Most of all my little brothers are what bring me true joy and happiness. I took hold of this and I try to spend time with them the best I can, and sometimes I won't because I'm in a state of self pity, but I'll realize what I'm doing and pull myself out of my bed and spend some time with them. It always helps me. I understand how you feel, but there has to be at least one thing that makes you feel in a non hurtful way. It may not come right away, but I'm sure you'll think of something if you really try hard.

1900,"People with no depression think that time is limitless. After a lot of thinking, I figure that a lot of people who don't suffer depression don't have the sense of time. There is just not enough time during the day (or year) to get to where you want or achieve what you want. People without depression can be so optimistic to start going to the gym at 40 or start a new business at 50. Time is very stressful to me, and the optimistic ones seem to live in LaLa land where they think they can get everything done and everything will work out great. Sometimes they shortcut it by cheating or doing so-and-so job to get that promotion",Yeah my life is over already I'm 22 and there's literally nothing I can do to start my life.

I've been eating so many plain turkey sandwiches.,"Can you just get one of those packages of pre-washed spinach and add those to your sandwiches as a start? Take what you have working for you and try to cram as many nutrients in as possible. Spinach is a good choice because it's pretty nutrient dense as opposed to lettuce, and it's easy to add to stuff. You can even grab a can on minestrone (or any other type) soup, heat it up and dump a bunch of spinach into it to boost the vegetable content. My go to recently has been a spinach salad with goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Maybe some day I'll get fancy and add onions or peppers or whatever to make it a real salad, but at this point, it's better than the grilled cheese by itself or whatever else I'm eating.

1926,"Easy work from home jobs no experience needed that are easy to get into?. Ya know, because depression. I keep losing all my jobs and I even maintain proper hygiene, I think time to find a work from home job before I end up on the streets...","There are tons of opportunities out there that can help you earn decent money. This includes: website testing, taking surveys, data entry, transcription, virtual assistant, and so on. Can I suggest you something? It's a process to recover from your depression. 1. The first thing you should do is to find out the top three things, basically your skills that you are good at and which can help you in some way for getting online jobs. 2. Make a list of such jobs that you can opt for as per your top three skill-sets. 3. The next thing is to look for free or paid online resources to learn about that job and start applying. I would suggest starting with some easy job that you can find without any trouble. For instance, you can do data entry in the beginning. After a few months, you can start doing transcription work, and then maybe move on to become a virtual assistant. So in this way, you will ultimately start earning a decent earning on your own. I hope this may help you.

I hate interacting with people. They state at me funny and act like I'm scary which makes me angry.

You may get like two good days, three bad days, some good days again etc. Until you keep getting more and longer stretches of good days. For me it's actually a sign that the meds are working.

1956,"People often say depression is emotional numbness, but I find it's more accurate for me to call it emotional constipation.. It's crude, I know, but really quite accurate. I find that my emotions build up, but there's never an outlet, and the more pressure I put or the more emotionally affected I should be, the harder it is to have any emotional output. It continues until something frees up and becomes loose - usually something small that slips through the cracks. At that point, the floodgates open - I get freed up to feel more strongly, usually with explosive effects.

I guess all the years of absolute self hatred were right, I'm a worthless fuck up who should probably just end it all.","There must be something making you feeling this way mate, you just gotta identify it.",0,0,0,1,0.448177307844162,0.23420079052448273,0.5481950044631958,0.39020466804504395,0.5155127048492432,0.25058284401893616,0.4907718896865845,0.6270296573638916,0.20621484518051147,0.48008859157562256,0.5281139612197876,0.4911454916000366,0.6275289058685303,0.470332533121109,0.3516821563243866,0.25711724162101746,0.5663495063781738,0.611365020275116,0.7265539765357971,0.8453923463821411,0,0.5522491335868835,0.25300732254981995,0.4393576383590698,0.2726477086544037,0.3898031413555145,0.27950918674468994,0.3578478991985321,0.5342767238616943,0.4018348753452301,0.4834928512573242,0.5113254189491272,0.43775635957717896,0.4491833448410034,0.7055109143257141,0.3946804106235504,0.1821170598268509,0.4408394396305084,0.49328792095184326,0.6773550510406494,0.5022169351577759

1967,"How do you deal with the pit of despair in your chest?. Personally, I like to look through hundreds of homeless dogs that I can't adopt until I can't take it anymore. Of course this only make me want to cry but it directs the pit and gives it propose a I can go to sleep.","Yeah, this feeling is a strong one. Felt it consistently for a lot of my childhood and early adulthood. The truth is that I never dealt with it constructively, or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling. Part of the reason I think you and I are on this in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively. In my case, I used constant denial and self-numbing ... At some point, I just assumed the pit was a part of me I could choose to ignore. You seem to be actively trying to experience it. You are engaging your sadness, which is objectively good for working through depression. It may not be what you might call 'conventional' but everyone does their thing a little differently :) If what you are doing no longer works for you though, it might be best to start looking for other (healthy) ways of working through that discomfort. Personally, when I feel that pit, I know what thoughts tend to follow it. Fortunately, my therapists (and my stay at hospital) helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard. In order to redirect those thoughts that create it, I try to reach out to anyone in my support net. It's hard because I feel like they won't give a shit, but most of the time, they do (but I often choose to ignore that reality). Or I will simply write some positive words here, on this. Reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others, but for my own sake as well. As you put so well, giving that pit a 'purpose'. But don't cover that feeling up. Continue to engage with it, as best as you can. It's there for a reason. Hopefully, the more you work with it, the easier it is to process and let go.",1,0,2,1,0.46111130714416504,0.2911168038845062,0.43951383233070374,0.3564477562904358,0.3959350287914276,0.28649216890335083,0.4474540054798126,0.5236034989356995,0.23165802657604218,0.4885055124759674,0.5025577545166016,0.4611092805862427,0.4691462516784668,0.6235397458076477,0.3752649128437042,0.18185357749462128,0.4412175118923187,0.48358291387557983,0.661659300327301,0.6205999255180359,0,0.3940037488937378,0.16208431124687195,0.5146153569221497,0.41849201917648315,0.48609641194343567,0.2839624583721161,0.371899276971817,0.6007860898971558,0.17307089269161224,0.2976771593093872,0.5524756908416748,0.19281449913978577,0.6917586326599121,0.708399772644043,0.2631702423095703,0.006581142544746399,0.574012815952301,0.6362122297286987,0.7601159811019897,0.6443342566490173

1978,When you have to stay alive for someone else. I just can't leave my friend who just lost a family member to suicide and I'm the closest friend. &amp;#x200B; But I just wanna die,"Well at least you still can hold on to that choice. Being terminally ill for the past 7 years (Im 42 now) the physical pain of a slow and horrible illness has led to my depression and desire to die. It is up to my wife though. And for her I live every day in hell. When you have even one person to keep you going, it can be enough. I am a lurker here and I read posts to give me perspective. Rarely can I physically reply. But what my experience being bound to a bed 24/7 has taught me is that once I made my peace with dying, I became indifferent to everything. For myself It's been tough to see people truly depressed to the point of wanting to die. I am very empathetic, but my depression is a symptom so its hard to understand. The one thing I do understand though is that the last thing you want to hear is Don't do it!!! Call this number... or other similar programmed/indoctrinated responses. So just know this... The world and life can be one big shitshow... So it helps to keep toilet paper handy. Let your friend be your toilet paper and be your friends toilet paper. It will be enough.  Lastly... Just remember that no matter how bad life feels (and is...) even I am artificially grateful for the fact that I have a far better life right now (suffering from *pain and bound to a bed), than 99.999999% of all humans to have ever lived. Just try to make it as long as you can. Know how much worse it can be. And let your toilet paper know that you need them to help clean up some shit. Then when you are ready to go.... You will know. But I cant see it happening for you as long as you remain attached to someone that you can call a friend. So give yourself a list of requirements that must be met for you to end it all. *- Pain so severe that causes me to vomit my own feces at times as it sends my body into shock. I wish you the best. I hope you can suffer less in time if possible. You and I are here right now... That makes us stronger than those who gave up yesterday. (And if you do one day come to the realization that you must go, make sure to do it in a way that allows your organs be given to help others. It helps me knowing that maybe I will have something that can give a healthy, long, and amazing life for a person who is still able to live it. ) Just think about making the list... And go tell your friend, right now, that you love him/her... Even if they are not quilted and only 1-ply thickness. You both need that right now... The whole world needs that right now.  Edit: sorry for the novella and my poor humor.

1980,Mental Health support. Mom says try harder. A doctor prescribes me pills. A councillor gives me kindergarten-level reading material and handouts. The internet gives me a phone number. Friends give me absence. The psychiatric ward gives me a doctor. But repeat after me... I have mental health support.,"Oh I know. In my opinion the true reason that you, me and about 90% of people with depression feels the way you portrayed in this post is because out of all those people who are support. no one really understands on a deep, emotional, and philosophical level how this disorder ruins your life and makes it miserably painful. The ONLY way you know is if you have experienced it yourself. Once you get truly depressed you enter the void. Some people are only in that void for some brief time, while clinically depressed people like ourselves live in this void. That support group doesn't speak our language. That's the fucking problem. They don't know the void. They can only read about the void, but they don't live in it. The support group approaches depression in the same way that males know what it's like to go through childbirth (no this is not a political push either way). It's just stating, THEY DONT but they can read all about it and try to imagine the pain, but they can never truly feel it. The subjective nature of emotions and life makes it beyond Fucking difficult to find people who know what you are truly talking about at your personal level.",1,0,0,1,0.4022260308265686,0.27054718136787415,0.565909743309021,0.2648560702800751,0.4688393175601959,0.30280807614326477,0.2884303033351898,0.6134058833122253,0.36650556325912476,0.46938589215278625,0.4388469159603119,0.4632968306541443,0.5740076899528503,0.6516493558883667,0.31415125727653503,0.2529872953891754,0.4387549161911011,0.5041592121124268,0.6651133894920349,0.6133258938789368,0,0.3759019672870636,0.1124589741230011,0.49404266476631165,0.4028525650501251,0.5004386901855469,0.29363468289375305,0.3057861924171448,0.6358400583267212,0.15712513029575348,0.31698012351989746,0.5308717489242554,0.20152266323566437,0.666883647441864,0.5718154311180115,0.22557245194911957,0.002042178064584732,0.5968248248100281,0.6462222933769226,0.6839990019798279,0.5967496633529663

1993,I showered today for the first time this week. I still feel like shit,"I think people are meant to regularly bathe. Like we have probably been bathing while still hairy and grunting. I wasn't raised the best; one thing is that I was never taught to bathe regularly. It was normal to bathe once every 2-4 weeks growing up. Basically, I never had it ingrained into me, which led to being super hygienic to the point of irritation and skin problems during puberty, and complete abandonment of hygiene during my intense depressive periods. So during these periods I would go as long as I could possibly can without showering until it was literally affecting everything I did, usually 4-6 weeks. My dirtiness would get into my eyes, and they would burn like hell. I got more skin problems from the build up of dead skin: in grown hairs, dry scaly skin, acne, etc. My hair had issues too: unhealthy and wiry possibly from an unhealthy scalp and follicles and dandruff. My dick had some infection and itched like hell. I also looked like shit too and was never prepared for events that forced me to go outside which made everything worse (I would hide and wait out people who potentially could see or interact with me, for example). I also was dirty and made my surroundings just as dirty, and I smelled bad, but luckily I don't have volatile BO. *Anyways*, just saying that there are some serious consequences to poor hygiene that I wish someone told me about.

1999,Depression is a vicious cycle.. Enter depression. Stay depressed for a long period of time. Barely get out of depression. Regret the time you've wasted being depressed. Enter depression.,"Yup, my therapist described this to me as a triangle: Thoughts fuel feelings which fuel our interactions which fuel thoughts. She said that the only way to escape the loop was to break one of the parts. Obviously breaking interactions would just put on a facade, so she suggested breaking either thoughts by changing perception to be more of what she called rational, (through looking at the ups and downs of any situation instead of deciding based just on the downs) or breaking feelings by re-evaluating them using a similar method. &amp;nbsp; I've always unknowingly found myself back in the loop over and over again, but what I would do in your situation would be to look at things objectively, put a self-aware lens over your life, see what you can do to make it better and make choices from there.",0,0,2,1,0.4801316559314728,0.22516518831253052,0.3399418294429779,0.29457926750183105,0.6233864426612854,0.3966110348701477,0.365818053483963,0.5474536418914795,0.06559842079877853,0.5626546740531921,0.41347387433052063,0.4018016457557678,0.50807124376297,0.4773763120174408,0.2434227168560028,0.21254493296146393,0.6263571381568909,0.4723486006259918,0.6412069797515869,0.7013699412345886,0,0.41320160031318665,0.263653963804245,0.5944128632545471,0.3829428255558014,0.49113985896110535,0.2464325726032257,0.27666476368904114,0.5498372316360474,0.2528837025165558,0.47259002923965454,0.5063089728355408,0.2927462160587311,0.6526424288749695,0.7185279130935669,0.3707939088344574,0.19288796186447144,0.5646013617515564,0.6033908724784851,0.8281616568565369,0.7371401786804199

Emotions can be hard to control and anger can be an easy out. It lets you feel powerful, in control of things. In therapy they teach you to sit-down often and sort through your emotions.

Try to walk yourself through some of these exercises. They might help you better understand your emotions so that you can control them in the future.",2,2,0,1,0.40905332565307617,0.15394942462444305,0.5387327075004578,0.442747563123703,0.5868809223175049,0.31566256284713745,0.4710022509098053,0.6562777757644653,0.08341848105192184,0.5227099061012268,0.4284612536430359,0.44607457518577576,0.5544549822807312,0.6617985367774963,0.3141646683216095,0.20499728620052338,0.5907289385795593,0.5696789026260376,0.6794105768203735,0.8386349678039551,0,0.42581701278686523,0.1183500587940216,0.6106899380683899,0.3886207640171051,0.5798753499984741,0.2387598305940628,0.30111151933670044,0.6173955202102661,0.1717415601015091,0.3733844757080078,0.4731546938419342,0.2741720378398895,0.7022603154182434,0.47952842712402344,0.26211538910865784,0.17751823365688324,0.553516685962677,0.6539487838745117,0.6318177580833435,0.6531842350959778

2039,Break even.. Do you think my partner whom broke up with me because of depression is feeling as hurt as I am right now? My former partner seems to be doing very well.,"Because of your depression or your partners?  My ex broke up with me because of hers. At the time she said she still loved me but needed to get better (really true, she was a nutcase). We recently talked after a few months of NC and her getting leveled out on anti-depressants. Her hurt was not the same as mine. Her emotions were flat-lined. Anhedonia. The sadness, anger, frustration, confusion, despair that I felt are emotions she was incapable of feeling. I know this because I was severely depressed myself years ago. Even now since she is on SSRI's, and with it being months later, I don't think her hurt is even close to what mine was. I think her hurt is more in regret. I honestly doubt she will ever truly hurt over this breakup - by the time she's off the meds and capable of feeling those raw emotions again, it will probably be a total of 1-2 years since the breakup. She'll only have to deal with regret - if even that.  Of course some cynical side of me wants her to feel what I did. I want her to grieve the loss of our relationship like I did. I want her to think about what we had, let those good memories fill her with the positive emotions we had together, and have them followed up by sadness over the realization she lost it. But when I really think about it, I know I don't want that to happen. She cried enough when she started sinking lower into depression. The outbursts, the frustration, the fear of losing me. I remember how much that happened. She hurt too, it just happened for months before the breakup, where mine was after.",0,2,2,1,0.48089727759361267,0.2845110595226288,0.6419855356216431,0.304522842168808,0.5475417375564575,0.3033711612224579,0.28482532501220703,0.729379415512085,0.2522733211517334,0.526820957660675,0.4539807438850403,0.4419482946395874,0.6141583323478699,0.7517934441566467,0.38637515902519226,0.2608851194381714,0.5216863751411438,0.6573259234428406,0.7061817049980164,0.6029170155525208,0,0.33241400122642517,0.1349753886461258,0.4999382793903351,0.44645169377326965,0.5619996786117554,0.24000395834445953,0.37314942479133606,0.48464569449424744,0.12146107852458954,0.4087485074996948,0.5068064332008362,0.23121973872184753,0.7174378633499146,0.4322451651096344,0.2057143598794937,0.1756265014410019,0.5995965600013733,0.6803756952285767,0.6648966670036316,0.7579286098480225
2040,Books to read that can help me with my anxiety. Hi everyone.

Where I'm at in the USA, BHR (Behavioral Health Resources) would be the place to inquire. I'm pretty sure they're nation wide but lack the resources to really help many people though. Mental health care system is a joke, especially in the low/no income sector. Worth pursuing if you're in need.

2075,Called into work because of depression (rant). So I have had clinical depression for as long as I can remember and sometimes I'll get these feelings where I don't want to do anything and just lay in bed. I know this is normal for people who have depression and usually I can fight it off but not today. I called into my job (which I love) and said I couldn't come in and now I want to punch myself in the face. I don't understand why I let my depression control what I do. I'm usually so good at keeping under control and not letting it rule my life. I feel so weak for giving in..,"Well, get up, have a shower and do something productive with your day. Finish that book you've always wanted to. Watch that movie you've been waiting to see. Make yourself an amazing dinner or better yet, make some cookies for your workmates. Go visit an animal shelter. Get outside for a walk. Everyone has days where they don't want to human. It's up to you though, if you are wanting to try.

Any tips on how I can deal with this?","There are judgment free gyms out there such as Planet Fitness. Alternatively, you can buy your own gym equipment (e.g., dumbbells, resistance bands, etc.) / videos (e.g., P90X, Insanity) and work out at home.

2088,I'm drowning.. I can't do this. I really can't do this.,I'm drowning too. Everyday. It easy to take shit for granted. I never thought my life would get worse. I thought I was invincible but life fucks you up in so many ways. You need to find some inspirational music and listen to it a lot. Maybe make a goal for something. I know it all seems futile but little things sometimes help. But I know how hard it can be. When you're caught under those dark deep waves. Surrounded by onlookers on their cruise. It's easy to say fuck it but you deserve to be happy..

2122,"College graduates/current college students:. How have you gotten through difficult parts of your school year when your depression is severely effecting your academic work? Going through a difficult path this semester and tanked two exams this week already, really looking for some advice to improve.","Yes, I have. Currently I am a mess. Nevertheless there used to be a time when I was a mess, but still had a reason to pick myself up and get my shit done. If you want to study and pass your exams, this is what I did: - Get busy studying now (within 15 minutes). No excuses to eat/drink a bit. Not going to the bathroom. Just study. Phone away. If possible laptop/computer away. Do this for at least one hour and take a small break to get fresh air if you want and drink some water. NO PHONE. Then back to studying. Again one hour or more. - After studying go for a run (I don't care if it is 11 pm) or exercise in some other way. - Eat healthy. You crave good tasting food? chocolate? chips? No go. When you go to the supermarket, fast food is not an option. You will not spend your money on that shit. No chips, no sweet stuff, no special drinks. Fruit/vegetables/carbs/meat/fish/bread/milk/yoghurt. Healthy stuff. Lots of water. - Go to bed on time. Get out of bed on time. - No thinking! Only actions. - Do one thing at a time. No thinking about tomorrow or the next hours. Just about the next minute. What are you going to do now? Shower? check. Dress? check. Breakfast? check. Go to library? check. Study one hour? check. Have a small break and drink water? check. continue. - If possible, study with other people - (added) When I get stuck, it has been VERY helpful for me to discuss this with other students. This has been very difficult for me, because I have a crazy amount of pride and am very ashamed of showing I do not understand something. Nonetheless, it has helped me so much to just discuss a problem where i got stuck with someone and then see the light which enables me to continue studying (instead of procrastinating till everything went to shit). This doesn't solve the deeper problems, but it probably will get you through your exams as good as possible. At least, this is how I managed to finish my undergraduate years. Not healthy, but it worked. Also you will probably find that by being so hard for yourself, setting boundaries and actually following them, you will start to feel a lot better about yourself and gain confidence. This is a trap, do not get satisfied with yourself. Being satisfied and giving yourself more space to slightly cross your boundaries again is equal to getting on the slide that will get you right back into the pit. This became a rant, hope it helps you in some way.",0,0,2,1,0.4553759694099426,0.38462239503860474,0.34665510058403015,0.2061527818441391,0.3410409390926361,0.2501307427883148,0.5151336193084717,0.564461886882782,0.48287051916122437,0.5398790836334229,0.5133642554283142,0.47574907541275024,0.44617408514022827,0.5223212242126465,0.39101162552833557,0.20476575195789337,0.28862717747688293,0.5772732496261597,0.6829413771629333,0.4670012295246124,0,0.40429240465164185,0.19337943196296692,0.4821303188800812,0.3660137355327606,0.46787577867507935,0.2646801471710205,0.39869076013565063,0.5167602896690369,0.18982742726802826,0.40788042545318604,0.4672186076641083,0.21189184486865997,0.6601220369338989,0.44311532378196716,0.2745033800601959,-0.0889643132686615,0.4455753266811371,0.6371634602546692,0.6624150276184082,0.4868376851081848

It actually isn't really much worse than it has always been. I read a certain amount of history and have come to realize this. Even if you just read the Old Testament you can see how crappy people were. One thing that helps me is to stay away from news. I don't think it makes us informed if all we know is the bad stuff. Also try subscribing and reading Uplifting News on a regular basis. Made Me Smile is also a good. Finally to really get informed about the good stuff going on in the world, volunteer.

If i tried to seek help with a doctor what process would I go through and what would most likely happen. in the U.S. if it makes a difference,"it *probably* depends on the state (edit: what state in the US). being 14, you are going to be tethered to your parent/guardian legally. the therapist/counselor/psychologist will be legally required to tell your guardians of anything that serves of specific risk. for example, i told my therapist that i was suicidal and he had to contact my mother and explain the basics of the situation. for self harm, im not sure exactly how/if the information would be disclosed by the therapist/counselor/psychologist to your parents.. but im assuming if you are physically hurting yourself to a GREAT EXTENT then yes, it would most likely be disclosed. im 18 now, and started seeing my on-campus(university) therapist and psychiatrist at the beginning of the school year, where i was 17. it sucks not being in control of your life, but what can you do, you know? if getting to see a therapist is an issue, i would recommend asking to talk to your doctor/pediatrician in private (during a normal check-up) and say tht youve had symptoms of depression/anxiety and you'd like to have some help talking to your parent about getting help. if it's not an issue of talking to your parent/guardian, then what's the worry? if you cant see a doctor, a school counselor could help you have this conversation with your parent! or even a supportive teacher that you trust. i went through a very similar situation when i was younger, and very much regret not being more persistent about getting help when i needed it. it mght not go away, and with school only getting harder and more stressful as you age, it's *really hard* to deal with all this emotional baggage. everyone deserves to feel the best that they can. you dont want to suffer anymore and someday you wont! feel free to pm me, i'd be happy to be your pen-pal through all this &lt;3",1,0,2,1,0.4601740539073944,0.3996465802192688,0.6207426190376282,0.27805036306381226,0.43781325221061707,0.449798047542572,0.3645130693912506,0.7100213170051575,0.5190690755844116,0.4758327007293701,0.5861674547195435,0.3887196481227875,0.48157575726509094,0.6538909077644348,0.3803071081638336,0.27254775166511536,0.3386686146259308,0.6278219223022461,0.6094202995300293,0.3820483982563019,0,0.42136362195014954,0.28758475184440613,0.4017029404640198,0.37536028027534485,0.41634830832481384,0.2472619265317917,0.3175014853477478,0.6873602271080017,0.24231918156147003,0.44763725996017456,0.5619531273841858,0.3162604868412018,0.6254565119743347,0.6095393896102905,0.3602809011936188,0.1748359203338623,0.5052382349967957,0.6724131107330322,0.7143184542655945,0.5252354741096497

2164,"you know what ,,,, i just want to die. i know people have it worse than me and people in houston have every single right to wish death upon themselves rather than me but oh my god i would give anything for someone to just break into my house and murder me.","Shit, my dude, other people will always have worse (or better) lives than us. That doesn't invalidate your pain. I look at it like this: As a kid, I would throw tantrums in the grocery store if my mom wouldn't buy my favourite cereal. A couple years later, I could handle that, but I cried when I got cut from the basketball team. A couple years after that, I was nearly suicidal when my girlfriend dumped me. I eventually learned to handle rejection, but full time work drove me to drug abuse. Now, I can handle working 50 hours a week. The point is I have always had terrible coping skills. None of my problems have ever been that bad, but they have been the biggest problem I ever faced. They always seem overwhelming because I don't know how to handle failure of rejection of really any kind of pain or even mild discomfort. I am a wimp. And yet, they still treated me at the hospital - multiple times. I was never told to suck it up; I was taken seriously and given the help I need. It isn't about the external circumstances, it's about how we react to them. So if you need help, *that's okay*. You aren't any less of a person. You are worth just as much as anyone else. Someone losing their home or family in Texas doesn't mean your problems are irrelevant at all!",0,0,2,1,0.4909084737300873,0.12885326147079468,0.5460058450698853,0.492488831281662,0.5504337549209595,0.34539616107940674,0.32681524753570557,0.6652965545654297,0.11154307425022125,0.4379799962043762,0.5182843208312988,0.4467175006866455,0.6019454002380371,0.7144594788551331,0.384662389755249,0.2919106185436249,0.6144440174102783,0.49922817945480347,0.6207916736602783,0.7402155995368958,0,0.43323829770088196,0.24628500640392303,0.5423734784126282,0.32572242617607117,0.5943349003791809,0.31180471181869507,0.39391276240348816,0.4799574315547943,0.19570983946323395,0.4689890146255493,0.5184913277626038,0.309146523475647,0.5359435081481934,0.4867419898509979,0.35657086968421936,0.19918949902057648,0.5216214060783386,0.7092238068580627,0.7572821378707886,0.6929478049278259

2168,one question. I'll keep it simple. Can there be happiness in despair? Because I think I felt it and I want to kill off any hope that's left for me.,"That's a pretty profound question, but I think happiness is something that a lot of people don't understand. In a period or prolonged period of despair, I don't believe there can be happiness at all, and it's only after that period has been solved, over, attacked enough by effort and time, that you can start experiencing happiness. I don't think happiness and gratitude should be forced, or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy. I'm still going through that period, and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way, but they are fleeting and leave very quickly. The whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories. Think about it, which memories are the quickest, strongest, and most easily able to be remembered for you? The most emotional ones. If your most emotional memories are negative, you will be in despair. On the converse, if one's most emotional memories are positive, you will be in a state of happiness. There is a way to end your despair, you just have to face it head on and let go of everything, and keep trying to let go and accept. Very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole.",1,0,2,1,0.5380047559738159,0.3241508901119232,0.515511691570282,0.34479227662086487,0.5347905158996582,0.31945979595184326,0.5140140652656555,0.5348659157752991,0.3575059473514557,0.5520168542861938,0.5153085589408875,0.4721892476081848,0.4788503348827362,0.5303951501846313,0.5047425031661987,0.23757492005825043,0.47750696539878845,0.546220064163208,0.6703956127166748,0.6119696497917175,0,0.4980411231517792,0.23034852743148804,0.4052544832229614,0.3814205825328827,0.5606752038002014,0.3136419653892517,0.4606083929538727,0.480780690908432,0.22537752985954285,0.39464569091796875,0.5805320143699646,0.2813442349433899,0.6795432567596436,0.5406569838523865,0.41031089425086975,0.1698249727487564,0.5257264971733093,0.6744633913040161,0.7470525503158569,0.645389199256897

2171,"Why is it so easy to blame ourselves?. It's strange, sometimes when I make mistakes that clearly not my fault I blame myself for it, but why is that and how can we stop blaming ourselves for everything?",I'm trying to increase my self worth so I stop doing this exact thing. My frustration immediately gets taken out on the one thing I seem to hate the most: me. I've started to set small goals for myself every day so each day feels like a success when I achieve those goals. This has led me to branch out and actually put myself out there. In doing so I'm discovering a passion for mental health advocacy and rekindling a love for doing creative stuff. I'm not saying everything has immediately gotten better. Holy shit it hasn't.

2172,"I beat depression. You can too.. Persevere, it is worth the fight.","Because depression isn't the same for everyone, so there is no 'one size fits all' cure for everyone. And some of the things you mentioned can be downright harmful for some people. For instance, tough love can potentially push a suicidal person over the edge. There's a reason those things are mentioned in the sidebar. Treatment should be left to the professionals to deal with on an individual basis. This sub is more of a support group, meant for encouraging each other to hang on, to keep fighting, and to point people in the right direction if and when they seek professional help. I'm sincerely glad you beat depression. What worked for you, though, may not work for everyone else (or even anyone else). It's a very personal and individual experience. And that's where you should have gone with this submission. You should've just shared your story. Talked about your depression, talked about your journey through it and how you beat it. Instead, you rolled it out like a sales pitch for snake oil. This is dangerous territory, because when you say things like I beat depression and you can too, here's how..., you are selling people hope. If it doesn't work and somebody spirals down and harms themselves or worse, even in one single instance, you are at least partially to blame for selling them that false hope. Again, that's why we leave treatment to the professionals. Please, I can't stress enough that you follow the rules and guidelines in the sidebar.

I like to start small, take control of whatever I can. Control is empowering. It could be a simple as just playing the shit out of a stupid flash game, or clearing out all the spam in your email, or reorganising your room. Just find something to keep yourself moving. Writing can help too, just lay it all out there. Seeing your words outside your head can help break the downward spiral of thinking. If it's worse now then that means was better, and it will be eventually. Think of someone you can talk to, who knows you well, and just hit them up and say hi. Maybe a text, maybe an email, just remind yourself that you are not alone. It's a shitty battle but stick it out if you can. If you have a therapist try reaching out to one, and if you don't then see if you can get a friend or a parent to help you find one. There's nothing magic about professional help, but it does work sometimes and that's reason enough to get the process rolling if you feel like you can.

2218,Screw life.. Kinda depressed for no reason,"I hope it gets better for you. Just remember to take care of yourself while you are depressed. What do you tell people to do when they are sick with the flu? You tell them to drink water, get plenty of rest, don't overexert, and eat bland foods. Drink tea, medicine, whatever. This is recommended for the most rapid recovery. If they neglect this advice, they run the risk of getting sicker. What do you tell someone who is sick with depression? Just do your best to keep up with life. Make sure you eat, make sure you sleep, brush your teeth, do whatever chores you would normally do, try not to turn to any vice or addiction, and avoid isolating yourself. If you upkeep with life, you are more likely to see a faster recovery. If you fail to upkeep, you run the risk of digging a hole and becoming more depressed. You are strong, and you got this.

Middle to high school are the developmental years, and having to deal with abdominal pains/bathroom runs every single day in that time period is frustrating I'm sure. With that said, there is just so much to look forward to. While your issues might fall onto deaf ears for people your age, IBD isn't going to be something that's going to prohibit you from living and leading a normal life. Special arrangements can be made for college/work(especially if you're working in a technical field, you might enjoy a mix of online classes) and you're going to find that people are generally more empathetic as you grow older. Hang in there man.

WTF should I do?","You are capable of doing things on your own. If your boyfriend doesn't make you happy, you don't have to be with him. If you are worried about coping, you can take things slowly, step by step. I should follow my own advice here as well: don't be afraid to seek therapy if you can. It will help, even if it only helps a little. As for your job, I'm sorry it didn't work out. But don't let things ruminate in your mind. Worrying about them over and over does nothing to help you. *Depression thrives in rumination*. Try looking into mindfulness meditation. It's not spiritual garbage, it's literally training the neural pathways in your brain to put less weight on particular thoughts, so that you don't get stuck in negative feedback loops. It takes time to change your brain structure, but it can be done. Another thing is to find distractions. Productive is better, but if you keep the less productive ones in check they can be helpful also. Delve into hobbies or learn a new skill. Be social and try new things. That's the best way to cope in my opinion. I need to take my own advice.",1,0,0,1,0.3975971043109894,0.17677226662635803,0.5907117128372192,0.4152098298072815,0.6497837901115417,0.2707628309726715,0.44507119059562683,0.649705708026886,0.10381506383419037,0.485979825258255,0.5116574764251709,0.4065675437450409,0.6028242707252502,0.6326469779014587,0.3785405457019806,0.17746752500534058,0.5594530701637268,0.5713606476783752,0.6686663627624512,0.7276500463485718,0,0.5266914367675781,0.22495417296886444,0.4082137644290924,0.36699986457824707,0.43288367986679077,0.22869202494621277,0.4313236176967621,0.5201699137687683,0.3213364779949188,0.3851456642150879,0.49765944480895996,0.30372509360313416,0.635248064994812,0.5899617075920105,0.3436914384365082,0.214969664812088,0.48366907238960266,0.728399395942688,0.7332088947296143,0.598784863948822

2227,When did you realize you were depressed?. What were the signs? When did you realize it just a slump or sad mood.,"I realize I had depression for a long time, and sometimes I still doubt I do but that may just be the illness. I just sort of always felt sad, or at most neutral, but I had a good job, finished school, and an active social life. It was the little invisible things that nobody ever saw. Staying in bed awake for hours on weekdays, intentionally isolating myself or lying so I could be alone and mope. I stopped exercising and gained a ton of weight. Hell I even had suicidal ideation and I just thought it was normal. I want to kill myself but I stop thinking about death and me dying. It sometimes felt like if I stopped existing it would be fine. I knew something was wrong but I was adamant it depression. Then I went to my doctor thinking I had an anxiety problem and he began to ask THE questions. I knew he was trying to see if I had depression and it caught me by surprise. Of course I lied for most of them. It would be embarrassing; there was no way I was depressed, but the thought had worked its way in. Over the course of a year I did some idle research. I realized suicidal thoughts and a fascination with death are not normal. I matched a lot of my behavior to symptoms of depression. I came to accept it.

2241,Not going to kill myself but I really want to die. What is the point?? Everything is shit anyway?? I really didn't ask to be born and then my parents put this life responsibility on me. Anybody else feel like this?,"omg lol I 100% blame my parents. After taking an AP Psychology course at my school, it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression. I know I can't claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook, but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents. The genetic aspects aren't their fault of course, but they are perfect human specimens, so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process. Strangely, being cognizant of that fact doesn't change it much. Of course, I've directly told my parents I blame them for who I am, and as perfect specimens, they told me that I can't keep blaming them for everything. There's truth to that of course, but it's rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility. I'd better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim, since they're the ones who work and pay for my existence, regardless of whether or not I can actually do jack shit about that (child labor laws, yo).

2243,"Self help without professional treatment. Hi, I believe that I may have major depressive disorder. I am going into college this coming fall and do not have the funds or time to seek professional help since school is coming so soon. What can I do to improve my life for the time being? Every day I face a lack of motivation, feelings of hopelessness, general sadness, and overall lethargy and laziness. Nothing I do motivates me and every time I try and do something I give up halfway through and never return to what I was doing.","I would say plan around your depression. You gotta give yourself more time to do stuff because there will be days where you just do work. If on average you give yourself 2 weeks to do a paper, give yourself 3 weeks and push yourself to work when you have good days. Know that going to be tiring to try to work as soon as your depression temporarily lifts and just take things in small increments. Write a paragraph a day for 3 weeks and or write two paragraphs when you miss a day due to depression and voila! Same results, different pace, depression included and worked around. Practice self care and indulge in the fee things that make you feel okay. stay in your dorm/apartment constantly. Seriously, even if you go to the library for a few hours a day, it helps with isolation. If you like to write, start roleplays with people on geeking or rolemance and reply when you need a break from academic writing. Otherwise indulge in low energy hobbies. And try to eat 2 meals a day even when you feel like it. It makes a difference. Overall, the transition is going to be rough and even more rough for you because of depression so try not to get stuck in a loop of bad habits. Break your routine if not making you feel good and professors are more understanding than not about late assignments and group projects. Be candid with them. Tell them you have the disability accommodations et but working on them.

2250,The smallest things really bring me down.. I know not the end of the world but why does it feel like it is? And if it feels like the end of the world why it actually end?,"Sometimes, when something happens in the moment, we see it as this huge thing because it is the center of our focus. It is only once those moments pass that we can look back and connect the dots to see that it really wasn't such a big deal. So my advice is this: As you look forward, remember that in the past the dots have always connected correctly, and have faith that those dots will connect the way they need to again. People often ask me why I don't worry about these seemingly huge problems in my life. Well, it's not that I don't worry, because I do. That's just being human, but I constantly remind myself that things usually just work out, and I just need to run the course that I see in front of me. So follow the course, stay on track, and when little problems feel like mountains in front of you, have faith that the dots will connect, and you will come out the other side as a stronger person.

2252,Everyday I wake up I look forward to going back to bed. A dream world is better than my reality,"It's not about what you do at work though it's what you do with your time outside of work. Most people's dreams don't come true no, that doesn't mean you should just waste away in a pitiful existence. Find excitement in things. Work hard. Achieve things. See progress. I've been in your place, completely cynical and want nothing to do with the way that society feels we should be. The truth is, you can find comfort in being yourself and falling into where you should be. Dreams of things exist because people see the start of something and then only the end of it (being famous, having lost all that weight etc...).

2254,"Natural remedies for fighting depression/social anxiety?. So, yeah. The title pretty much sums it up. I would like to hear personal stories of success(and also failure).","Supplements: --- Fish oil: There is some evidence that fish oil with 2 EPA to 1 DHA ratio helps with depression. Helps me a bit but maybe placebo effect. 5-HTP: Tried while really depressed/anxious and it didn't help. SSRIs didn't either and only a long acting Benzo did anything beneficial. Might try again later. Valerian root: Calms some people down. Doesn't do much for me. Rhodiola Rosea: Apparently gives you more energy while keeping you calm. Maybe a bit more energy for me but could be placebo effect. St. John's Wart: Supposed to be a natural antidepressant. I am thinking of trying it soon. Magnesium: Helps some people (assuming deficiency exists) but I have not tried it yet. Alcohol: Works great to calm social anxiety in a moment! Don't consume if taking prescription drugs. Consume in moderation if you need to drive home. Marijuana: Can really elevate mood, depends on the person. Can be combined with alcohol for added effect. Don't drive at all after using it. Don't use if illegal where you live or your employer drug tests. --- Lifestyle: --- Exercise: Some people rave that being active reduces anxiety and depression. In my case the gym is actually a trigger. I do enjoy going for a walk on a nice day though. Diet: I have started eating better and less. I have lost substantial weight and feel physically better. The sense of accomplishment and feeling better about my body has probably helped my depression. Travel: If you can afford it take a vacation and go see the world. Go alone so that you can discover your true self and not be at the whim of another person. It was an extremely positive experience for me. ---",0,0,2,1,0.5277098417282104,0.40881776809692383,0.3675898313522339,0.24376128613948822,0.32001927495002747,0.21503226459026337,0.5144043564796448,0.5419069528579712,0.639234185218811,0.46450215578079224,0.5189681053161621,0.4943556785583496,0.5129167437553406,0.5429258346557617,0.41772523522377014,0.21405212581157684,0.2791511118412018,0.5714722871780396,0.6640145182609558,0.3818345367908478,0,0.4345065951347351,0.1267767995595932,0.45194539427757263,0.4373115599155426,0.5855726599693298,0.29994261264801025,0.29512688517570496,0.5527481436729431,0.19042234122753143,0.2981276512145996,0.5298963785171509,0.26569628715515137,0.6069477796554565,0.5686396956443787,0.27452990412712097,0.07436597347259521,0.5592232346534729,0.6373530626296997,0.6568682789802551,0.604217529296875

Im passing through a huge crisis right now,"what are you needing help with? part of the problem with anti depressents is how easily and flippantly they are prescribed. There is use for these medications but should be far more proper professional analysis before determining the correct meds, and monitoring. Lack of health care support means throwing the most widely used ones at a patient, refer a psych and hope for the best. They are not terrible, can help in many people but take so long to be effective and are hit and miss so its a tough solution when in a present difficult crisis. Sometimes doctors will prescribe short term assistance like Benzos and tranquilizers to keep stable in the short term, I found this works better for me than long term anti-depressents.",0,2,2,1,0.5359503030776978,0.28224799036979675,0.6000862121582031,0.31786471605300903,0.49325665831565857,0.5172783136367798,0.31326666474342346,0.543594241142273,0.17189840972423553,0.46257317066192627,0.5722308158874512,0.500736653804779,0.495615690946579,0.5242232084274292,0.39348104596138,0.4640441834926605,0.46825143694877625,0.5338771343231201,0.6910662055015564,0.7070111632347107,0,0.4334474205970764,0.2451004981994629,0.5030519962310791,0.37144920229911804,0.5318407416343689,0.25058674812316895,0.25110194087028503,0.5679065585136414,0.1724311262369156,0.45286238193511963,0.5106427073478699,0.2842877209186554,0.6102599501609802,0.5499103665351868,0.2501756250858307,0.22919587790966034,0.5465721487998962,0.5894168019294739,0.7192949056625366,0.7156867980957031
2258,"“Fetishizing sadness”?. I just finished binging BoJack Horseman, and something that gets brought up semi-regularly is your own What is this and how do I avoid it?","It means that you have transformed your misery in a fundamental aspect of your identity and anything and everything that happens in your life is gonna be somehow linked to that. It is gonna become impossible to differ between what is truly a hardship from what you are deciding to see as such, because pain has settled within yourself to the point that things would not make any sense if it was not present, so you will inflict it upon yourself to return to the only state of familiarity that you know: being miserable. The term fetishizing is used in a harsh, accusatory, pejorative way, blaming the characters for perpetually watching their lives through the blackest prism, but the truth is they just do not know any better than to do so. Furthermore, fetishes are often believed to be shameful and obscene in nature, because such random, nonsexual items PRODUCE intense satisfaction, whereas people that are accused of fetishizing sadness are just sheltering themselves (if i fuck myself up, no one else will).",0,0,0,1,0.49081239104270935,0.19974447786808014,0.4608844816684723,0.3615083694458008,0.4801166355609894,0.25874826312065125,0.46537694334983826,0.5874646902084351,0.21431921422481537,0.5177963972091675,0.461990624666214,0.42735910415649414,0.583779513835907,0.5840271711349487,0.4069399833679199,0.05330038443207741,0.42867961525917053,0.5051754713058472,0.6811901330947876,0.6250218152999878,0,0.42930805683135986,0.19858603179454803,0.50788414478302,0.4180411100387573,0.5111638307571411,0.22404597699642181,0.27827706933021545,0.6662864685058594,0.2531653642654419,0.40068286657333374,0.5052606463432312,0.2926666736602783,0.6175654530525208,0.6599723100662231,0.300216406583786,0.1270551234483719,0.6100512146949768,0.5634883642196655,0.8035532236099243,0.8332645893096924

I miss my personality....",0,0,2,1,0.46387189626693726,0.18383875489234924,0.5149058103561401,0.28316938877105713,0.5383638143539429,0.2980249524116516,0.4341517686843872,0.5916860699653625,0.18623985350131989,0.45537281036376953,0.47895777225494385,0.4430626630783081,0.5159577131271362,0.5809856057167053,0.3082429766654968,0.2513432800769806,0.4290916323661804,0.4738738536834717,0.6656414270401001,0.7223094701766968,0,0.5156200528144836,0.22404007613658905,0.4536643624305725,0.12973536550998688,0.45582520961761475,0.18226782977581024,0.5814247727394104,0.497864693403244,0.21748806536197662,0.45535072684288025,0.4700991213321686,0.34635642170906067,0.5335270762443542,0.41669419407844543,0.5582447648048401,0.21438343822956085,0.3358477056026459,0.4441238045692444,0.49271321296691895,0.5687952637672424

2265,"i need to bleed. which area is the most painful yet least dangerous to cut? i can handle physical pain, but i need this emotional anguish to go away.","Cutting the topside of my arms hurt and bled but they clotted pretty quickly. Please use a sterile blade if you're going to cut yourself, and don't go any deeper than just the surface skin. Take it from me as someone who has used self-harm, an infection is not the sort of pain that helps with emotional relief! I also recommend other methods, there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far, far safer than cutting. Are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water? Boiling water shouldn't be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting, so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds. On the other end of the scale I found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as I could helped! I thought it would just make my hand feel numb, but it creates a localised, sharp unbearable sensation that works wonders to distract me.",0,0,2,1,0.5144879221916199,0.08825476467609406,0.4756185710430145,0.29253095388412476,0.499843955039978,0.41499820351600647,0.5569639801979065,0.419709712266922,-0.002832230646163225,0.5434308648109436,0.5310052633285522,0.4878619313240051,0.533750057220459,0.4200027883052826,0.3754178583621979,0.3150469958782196,0.4990004897117615,0.5111362934112549,0.6656298637390137,0.7409647107124329,0,0.45230379700660706,0.21394921839237213,0.5992043018341064,0.4138273298740387,0.548732340335846,0.2686607241630554,0.2871003746986389,0.5319369435310364,0.2278020679950714,0.4169366955757141,0.5100951194763184,0.35530877113342285,0.624720573425293,0.6327711343765259,0.3256968557834625,0.2886122167110443,0.5858961343765259,0.5572819113731384,0.7028161883354187,0.8128787875175476

So deal with our problems head on and TRULY acknowledge them. Of course the hard way to go because going to hurt so much but after that process we will be free of our pain.

Getting a pension would be really nice, if you have that in your country, but it's usually quite low. But beside that, the health is too damn hard. Of course you got 70 years old being president or running marathon and all. But I've seen people around me and it's just a blend of being tired, in pain, and or being slow, clumsy, close to handicap doing basic things. It scares me, especially with all the diseases that my relatives have or had, and the fact that I don't take care of my body as well as I could/should...

2354,How did you (If you did) beat depression?. I'm curious to know how y'all did it.,"I watched a short video once (I'm sure can google but I'm on phone and about to get in car) that compared depression to a big black dog. On bad days the dog is giant and weighing you down and on better days the dog is small and at your feet. This helped me accept a lot more about my life and my depression rather than constantly wishing it could just go away. I would get so mad at myself for being angry/sad but now I know it's like owning an animal--you take care of it and it won't bite you, at least not as much anyway. It's part of who you are and that is okay. I do not have severe depression so I am not on meds, so can't speak for those folks who are, but for me exercise and doing things for me (rather than constantly for others or other people's approval) really helped. It's like learning to be selfish in a good way. Eating less carbs and gluten helped too as they tended to make my body more sluggish which did t help when I already felt sad/slow/tired. I eat a lot more protein and fresh veggies now and I think there is a big difference--especially after 6+ months. I still drink alcohol but now a limited variety of stuff that I truly like the flavor of rather than eh it's here so I'll drink it. Also I don't drink when I'm in a bad place or anything traumatic happened that day/week. It's just a recipe for bad. I don't do any other drugs and I'm allergic to smoke so can't speak on that. I also drink 0 caffeine but that's mostly due to stomach issues--not sure if that would help or not. Good luck!",0,0,2,1,0.47639134526252747,0.24281208217144012,0.5166890621185303,0.32709211111068726,0.46482130885124207,0.23646531999111176,0.4958828091621399,0.5978293418884277,0.4137190878391266,0.5072856545448303,0.48524072766304016,0.4387204349040985,0.5279938578605652,0.5725994110107422,0.400539368391037,0.19740058481693268,0.38833364844322205,0.6004415154457092,0.6629064679145813,0.4897960424423218,0,0.46955952048301697,0.23582513630390167,0.5365903377532959,0.35733669996261597,0.5240681171417236,0.25494709610939026,0.4553365111351013,0.5181635618209839,0.26804307103157043,0.4569123387336731,0.5329031944274902,0.35157492756843567,0.6279525756835938,0.6248730421066284,0.3771795332431793,0.24519437551498413,0.49201148748397827,0.572006344795227,0.7264465093612671,0.7420815229415894

I don't want to live anymore but I can't bring my self to commit suicide. I'm scared of missing out on a potentially better life. Please help,"I probably would have considered bringing harm to myself and others if not for writing. Do you write? I find it helpful to seal away any self-detrimental desires inside characters who are not me. If you purge all of your thoughts out of your head and onto the page, you might find some relief. Literature is one of the most important inventions for resolving issues and you may find purpose through writing for yourself. My life is not pleasant by any means so I created the life that I want in my writing. My life became better through writing. What ideas and notions could be lost if you left us so soon? What adventures could you go on in your own book? Think of all the memories that could be shared. You could even write about a role-model. Mine is Typhon, the Greek dragon under the mountain. I obsess over this mad titan to keep myself calm. He shows up in all of my work. My advice would be to pound that pain out into a character, a mighty simulacrum, an indestructible artifact to contain your every fear. I'm not sure if I'm phrasing this well enough to help, but this is the only way I know how to express myself.",0,2,2,1,0.403263658285141,0.38821864128112793,0.48124203085899353,0.16821375489234924,0.2225174903869629,0.3596099019050598,0.29344937205314636,0.5819840431213379,0.3251178562641144,0.516548752784729,0.4866222143173218,0.1510971337556839,0.4985869824886322,0.6820444464683533,0.34910348057746887,0.2075369656085968,0.5824406147003174,0.4894063174724579,0.6573716402053833,0.6198696494102478,0,0.5782642960548401,0.3903923034667969,0.47715434432029724,0.3160039186477661,0.38606733083724976,0.20564325153827667,0.6188117265701294,0.5451720952987671,0.41045430302619934,0.567895233631134,0.6446466445922852,0.3674960732460022,0.6107515096664429,0.6725826859474182,0.5027714371681213,0.24704523384571075,0.38627976179122925,0.6526228189468384,0.8651025295257568,0.5530320405960083

2379,"I'm fighting since last year and still there is so much to conquer.. I want to write about just one aspect of my journey. It's about a year since I've started lifting, I've gained 15kgs (33lbs), but I'm still very skinny and weak. I fucking hate when people laugh at me becouse they never spent a one single day in the gym, they are naturally better built, stronger, have bigger body frame, more T level. They even don't have to point at me, I fell some kind of sadness, but I know I have to swallow the bitterness...  Thank you for your attention.",You're out there and improving yourself.

2381,Someone please come and break my legs and put me in hospital. I can't go to work anymore,"Dude. broken my arm so bad that I needed a titanium rod. I was in hospital for 5 days. Let me tell you that it was the most depressing and humiliating thing ever. I was in a ward with a man who was dying from pancreatic cancer and another one who was about to have his legs amputated because of diabetes. It is absolutely miserable seeing them alone throughout the entire day waiting for a visit and sometimes they have anyone come over at all. Furthermore, the medical staff were stretched so thin that I had to scream and bear unspeakable pain for 45 minutes before I could get my shot of painkillers. This was after they had attached the rods to my arm. Oh and last but not least, absolutely humiliating to use the restroom or shower. I understand and appreciate the efforts the medical staff commit but I really help but feel embarrassed when they shower me or escort me to the restroom. wish to be admitted to the hospital.

2388,Wish I was never born. Not looking for attention or advice to look on the bright side just hoping to get some perspective on how I feel. And maybe what it means psychologically to feel this way. All of my life I've felt like the black sheep. I never fit in anywhere really. I wish I was never born. I feel like I haven't impacted anyone's life and if I did it was negative or non existent. I should feel like I have a purpose. I have been married 6 years two kids later but even then if I died tomo who would care? How would the world be different. I just spoke to my husband about(hoping to maybe get some comfort in knowing I impacted his life for the better?) this was his exact words were yeah well I see how you could think that that was it. It broke me and felt like it validated my point. This life feels life a prison. It feels worthless and sickening to know no matter where I go it does t really even matter. How many others feel this way????,"Yeah, I resonate with a lot of what you're saying. It's only on a place like here or a depression support group that you would find others that feel this way.

Don't rush I to a relationship and don't have your head in the clouds thinking that its going to be heaven on earth. Don't be blinded from your emotions and always pay attention to reality.,1,0,2,1,0.5333231687545776,0.3284509778022766,0.5049730539321899,0.3283884823322296,0.4929979145526886,0.29782307147979736,0.48828092217445374,0.5156946182250977,0.26772359013557434,0.5502278208732605,0.5335172414779663,0.4923327565193176,0.5505349040031433,0.5235957503318787,0.4482493996620178,0.21723154187202454,0.4050745368003845,0.5198847055435181,0.6890150308609009,0.6102452278137207,0,0.5399602055549622,0.29496002197265625,0.41086816787719727,0.2676548361778259,0.4691218435764313,0.2749256491661072,0.4242962896823883,0.616662859916687,0.31599342823028564,0.5591070652008057,0.5563904047012329,0.4736829698085785,0.48813390731811523,0.6866769790649414,0.34424445033073425,0.195786252617836,0.5128505825996399,0.470508337020874,0.6102312803268433,0.6766847968101501
2404,I'm just having a bad day. It will get better tomorrow/next week/ next month/ next term/ next year. Spoiler alert: It fucking doesn't,"It really doesn't. And I feel that the older I become, the less likely that things will actually get better. When I was younger and receiving medical help, there was still the general feeling that I'd eventually grow up and things would be sorted out. Having recently summing up the determination to see a shrink again, I get the feeling that nothing much can be done. I even wonder if I actually have depression.

2405,"I can't wait to hopefully look back at my life now and realize it was all worth it, and that the pain will go away.. I just want to be happy. thats all","It may not seem like it now, but whatever you're feeling is just a step forward. Without now, next can't happen. The Moment you finally become happy is the same moment you realize all the pain was worth it. Everything you're experiencing is a unique experience that you and only you will ever experience. Why not make your unique experience a happy one? If you need help being happy or finding it, go explore and see what you like. Whether it be asking people online, or going and experiencing something for yourself when you look back, you'll be happy you did it, and happiness is all that matters.",0,0,0,1,0.5616304874420166,0.3214682638645172,0.39731302857398987,0.02137511782348156,0.3169190585613251,0.22689945995807648,0.7193151712417603,0.450771301984787,0.5935143232345581,0.544030487537384,0.43042585253715515,0.4364754557609558,0.6155125498771667,0.3038440942764282,0.36339864134788513,0.21576538681983948,0.3410666286945343,0.5125425457954407,0.6015925407409668,0.19238299131393433,0,0.4361110031604767,0.20587585866451263,0.5650171041488647,0.3522244691848755,0.4888807535171509,0.2082410752773285,0.30360618233680725,0.6336416602134705,0.3181683123111725,0.3954257071018219,0.48771604895591736,0.2848924398422241,0.6783218383789062,0.5446345210075378,0.317958801984787,0.12704604864120483,0.5084033608436584,0.6084370613098145,0.6510931849479675,0.48606249690055847
2406,I’m so tired of feeling depressed. I just want to be happy and not fake happy,Same. I used to go to a psychiatrist through my university but since I graduated havent been to see one. It's been 7 months and I have an appointment in August with a new dr. but I'll need to do something by Monday because tomorrow is my last dose of bupropion. These last couple of months have been awful. I have no motivation to do anything which is why I'm out of medication. I've procrastinated and it sucks. When I was seeing the dr. I would actually be happy. Like have moments where I just feel at peace and truly happy. I miss the fuck out of those moments. At least before I didn't know what I was missing.,0,0,2,1,0.5945412516593933,0.4917221665382385,0.3440828025341034,0.3026977777481079,0.4826289117336273,0.19960744678974152,0.6143631339073181,0.4665697515010834,0.3644338548183441,0.5627421140670776,0.422212690114975,0.5798834562301636,0.41554924845695496,0.5354414582252502,0.5630736351013184,0.19705966114997864,0.41059577465057373,0.5847377181053162,0.5678753852844238,0.550545871257782,0,0.4187711775302887,0.2796483337879181,0.5760709047317505,0.34833821654319763,0.530562698841095,0.27113592624664307,0.4105963408946991,0.5320742130279541,0.26063230633735657,0.4323509931564331,0.5044298768043518,0.35504788160324097,0.6491537094116211,0.4729519188404083,0.36026614904403687,0.23165471851825714,0.49096277356147766,0.6245903968811035,0.7174960970878601,0.6080365777015686

2409,The only person who noticed that something was wrong was I guy I just met.. I was at a party with my friends at one of their friends places. I became EXTREMELY depressed after having a couple drinks. Basically I wanted my life to be over. I was ready to walk outside and get hit by a car. I became very isolated. None of my friends came to my side or even seemed to notice me. But the host of the party came outside and asked me if everything was alright. It was completely insulting that these people I've known for over 10 years didn't come to my side. It was a guy who I knew less than 5 hours who noticed something was wrong...,"I know it isn't always possible, but you could try and hang out with other kind of people.

You can do this",1,0,2,1,0.43186837434768677,0.23464591801166534,0.4484184682369232,0.31780990958213806,0.43446242809295654,0.2645152807235718,0.55536949634552,0.5454737544059753,0.30330345034599304,0.5095306634902954,0.5560805797576904,0.44914698600769043,0.5476689338684082,0.4055459797382355,0.2797933518886566,0.19646550714969635,0.3695603609085083,0.47350263595581055,0.6422481536865234,0.562000572681427,0,0.5223392248153687,0.35882413387298584,0.3611896336078644,0.33103132247924805,0.6043363213539124,0.2759011387825012,0.4370054304599762,0.5418775081634521,0.34091365337371826,0.44803696870803833,0.5782497525215149,0.4023503065109253,0.545771598815918,0.5869833827018738,0.3524928092956543,0.296333372592926,0.40278276801109314,0.6690056324005127,0.7384783029556274,0.6547790765762329

2429,"I'm gonna become an alcoholic. I don't want to. I haven't touched a drop of booze in my life. I don't really have access to it, as I'm underage. But I think more and more about drinking every day, and I wonder if it will work to mediate the symptoms just a bit. My grandfather is a recovering alcoholic, and I don't want to follow in his footsteps, but I know I will eventually. I'm just waiting to see when I snap.","I'm down in that hole. Don't get sucked in is my advice. You'll get nothing good out of it. The thing with alcohol is that, once you start drinking too much, too often, the idea that it makes you feel better is entertained while it is not true at all. It's: *I drink to forget, but I've drank so much I don't know what it is I have to forget. So I drink, just to be sure.* Alcohol and drugs have become a habit for me and I can't really live without them anymore. I need them to maintain a level of tolerable shittiness - but trust me, I'd be way less miserable if I never started it.",0,0,2,1,0.3946504592895508,0.1405908316373825,0.5817208290100098,0.39034003019332886,0.527252197265625,0.2743689715862274,0.3802667558193207,0.5809459090232849,0.1614629477262497,0.4199068546295166,0.4705390930175781,0.3251161575317383,0.70650714635849,0.5300975441932678,0.36287692189216614,0.13412542641162872,0.47671738266944885,0.6266489028930664,0.7074453234672546,0.7429287433624268,0,0.4155716001987457,0.17703652381896973,0.5675530433654785,0.4013601243495941,0.5520215034484863,0.23020435869693756,0.4412406086921692,0.5775792002677917,0.19462208449840546,0.4659111201763153,0.5461646318435669,0.3254242539405823,0.6667441725730896,0.527555525302887,0.3390031158924103,0.21691808104515076,0.5611213445663452,0.6209344863891602,0.6773768663406372,0.7488498687744141
2430,Emotionally abused people. Please tell me your stories if you feel like it. Who abused you? How it affects you? I want to prove myself that my case is not that bad and i can make it.,"I'm game and need to vent so here goes... I was verbally, physically and emotionally abused for as long as I can recall. Since you asked about emotional abuse I will focus solely on that. I was blamed constantly for everything that was wrong with the family. My mother told me this numerous times after she and my father would have huge, physically violent fights that started over events that had nothing to do with me. I was constantly told If you had a brain you would be dangerous. by my mother. Not after I'd done anything, not after a stupid act or action on my part but just in passing. This was my mother's assesment of me and she told me this frequently. I was tested, determined to have a high IQ, placed in gifted and talented classes and made to suffer for it by narcissistic, superficial, egotistical mother for my entire life. If I vot an A I was told it was because the work was too easy for me, if I got a B it was because I was lazy and never applied myself. I would constantly be accused of thinking I was So smart. Nothing I ever did or attempted to do was good enough, there was always some flaw in it. I only received criticism, never any praise. In 4th grade I had lovely long hair, my mother decided I should have it all cut off. She took me to a beauty school and had them cut all of my hair off, a boy cut, they shaved the back of my neck. My mom cried afterward and said she was crying because The haircut showed how ugly I was. The next week we were going into our small town to pick up this giant fancy framed picture for our living room, My mom made me walk on the opposite side of the street after we got out of the car. She said, I don't want to be seen with you and have people know you are my daughter. My mother really values externak beauty. I was a skinny unremarlable child, I never forgot the other side of the street incident, I had to look at the damn framed picture that we picked up that day until I moved away from home and got married at age 19. Every time I saw it I thought of that day. Years of torture. I was a divorced single mother, my ex never paid a dime, not any of the support we were supposed to receive. I worked two jobs to support us. I never received any financial help from anyone. I crafted a nice career for myself and tried to be a good mom and a good person. I never drank, never did drugs or ran around or went wild or got in any trouble. But my mother was/is ashamed of me and made/makes sure to let me know it. Anyone she talks about to me she lets me know how successful their children are, how wealthy they are and how proud the parents are. My mom told me one day how disappointed she was with how I'd turned out, how she always thought I'd be someone when I grew up. She said she'd hoped I would've grown up to marry a doctor or lawyer or someone important. I told her I was someone. At the time I was an online database adminstrator with a nationally recognized nonprofit but to my mother I was an embarrassment, a nothing and a nobody. My mother's father, my grandfather was one of the only people in my life that was always kind to me, he treated me like I was special and had value. My mother knew I adored him and she hated that he liked me. After he died she insisted on telling me horrible things about him saying she wanted me to know what kind of man the grandfather I worshipped really was and that I should not feel special that some thing like him tolerated me better than most. Right after I was divorced, I was not yet employed full time and very poor. I was visifing my parents at their huge house in the country. My mother started bitching about how poor I was, I had not asked her or dad for a dime and I was not there to eat. Mom started talking about dying, asked me if I had a sill, etc.. Mom told me I better not die because she did not want to have to spend her money on a funeral for me, and she said not that anyone would show up at a funeral for me anyway. She also told me that she'd always thought of me as a living abortion, since my birth. She was going nuts, yelling and spitting. She told me she bet I was so poor, such a failure that I probably could not even afford feminine products. I got my purse to leave, opened it and hurled a few tampons at her, as I told her, wrong bitch. My father blocked the front door, and tried to make me apologise to my mother. I had to threaten to call the police before he would let me go. After my father passed away my mother called, she said she needed to ask me something. Then mom said, Did you ever think or get the feeling that your father really loved you or cared about you? I told my mom that yes, yes I did. That dad was a fifties guy and although he may not have ever been emotionally demonstrative I thought he did love and care about me. He has worked hard and made personal sacrifices to care for us financially when I was young. That there had been a few occassions that he'd been very nice to me. Like going into a shop and buying me a top he knew I wanted for my 16th Birthday. Buying me a computer, working with me on computer projects early on, buying us both laptops, teaching me to shoot and fish, and by his having special nicknames and greetings for me, etc.. I told mom that was how dad expressed his love. My mother said, That's interesting because I always had the impression that he didn't care about you at all. I was also emotionally abused by my father, it was different than my mother's abuse though. My dad alwsys had to be the best. He could not stand for me to be good at anything I could never, ever be as good as he was or (god fobid it) better. My parents were never involved in our education. They basically just asked us at dinner how school was and we'd say OK and dinner would proceed. I should have known from past events not to dare say anything positive had happened but one day I was happy and excited about something that had happened at school, in English class. I was so excited that I stupidly spoke up at dinner. When the standard, How was school? question was asked I boldly said, School was great, Mrs. G, my English teacher pulled me aside after class. She told me a poem I'd written for an assignment was so good they want my permission to publish it on the first page of the student yearbook! My father put his fork down, he tilted his head, gave me a bizarre look and told me to recite the poem. I could not recite it, I was too nervous and afraid. I said I would show it to him after dinner, it was no big deal. No, dad wanted to hear this fabulous poem I had written, right then. I went and got the poem and started to read it out loud. Dad told me to give it to him to read. He told me if it was in the yearbook people woukd be reading it for themselves. Dad read it silently and then while scoffing and half laughing he read it aloud. Dad asked me if the idiots at my school really thought that was good writing? He said he bet he could write something right then that would be a hundred times better. Dad left the table and went to his desk while we all sat at the table waiting for his return. After about twenty minutes Dad cheerfully returned, poem in hand. He stood and read it to us. It was some lame poem with Brother can you spare me a dime as one of the lines. Dad then told us, See, that's a poem, that's what good poetry is like! After that he asked all of us, Wasn't my poem better, a lot better? We all agreed, and lied and said his poem was a lot better. I told the English teacher not to let them use my poem for the yearbook. I never wrote another poem or much else for that matter. That crap happened in 1975 and I am still not over it despite counseling. Another thing that was a form of emotional abuse was the family hierarchy. My father came first, then my sister or mother, then me. I.always came last, even though I was the eldest child. There was this thing with the food. If we had any serving size type of meat it came into play. Let's say it is steaks for dinner, they are on a platter. The largest steak is for Dad, younger sister gets the next largest, mom third largest and smallest was for me. It was like that with all of the food. It was an unwritten rule. I decided to challenge it once when the platter of Hamburgers was beside me. I knew better than to go for the one for Dad but tried to take the secind largest one. My mom was immediately shrieking at me, No, no, put that back, it's for your sister! Yours is the small one. My parents home has our family pictures hanging in the study, they are hung vertically on one wall. The order is from top to bottom, a picture of my dad, a picture of my mom, a picture of my sister, a picture of my son, then a picture of me. I.am at the very bottom, like always. I.endured physical, emotional and mental abuse. I've seen therapist on occasion over the years and at one point was in therapy sessions twice a week for a year. It helped but it hasn't enabled me forget. I just have to deal with what happened and move forward. I'm not social, I don't really trust anyone or have any close friends but I'm okay with that. TLDR: Emotionally abused, made me tough, I survived it with a bit of therapy. Edit: Added TLDR",0,0,2,1,0.4746362864971161,0.147848978638649,0.5490500926971436,0.35503488779067993,0.42820873856544495,0.26619815826416016,0.44174766540527344,0.6147579550743103,0.3006017804145813,0.4808862507343292,0.5342656970024109,0.4359642565250397,0.5429759621620178,0.6487107276916504,0.33752894401550293,0.25682687759399414,0.5516250729560852,0.5409250855445862,0.6787154674530029,0.776800274848938,0,0.44288310408592224,0.14335940778255463,0.5505539178848267,0.4481521248817444,0.6671439409255981,0.3031842112541199,0.43689438700675964,0.5369759202003479,0.030089154839515686,0.3733816146850586,0.5971259474754333,0.3160056471824646,0.6496709585189819,0.6388419270515442,0.29129794239997864,0.24288377165794373,0.7895475029945374,0.6828510165214539,0.7733305096626282,0.9172053933143616
